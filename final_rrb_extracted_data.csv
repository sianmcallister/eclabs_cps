traveled through schools, school support organizations, and the

potent messengers -- that led us to this moment where CPS w ants to
make a real change in how it thinks about school impro vement (e.g. ,
new accountabilit y policy , new professional learning plan focused on
learning conditions and continuous impro vement, adoption of Cultiv ate
and Elev ate district -wide). W e know that CPS is ahead of the field
