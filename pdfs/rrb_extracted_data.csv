What are the most effectiv e beha vior management str ategies for impro ving
classroom dynamics and student engagement?
What are the common challenges faced b y teachers in implementing
behavior management str ategies, and how can these challenges be
addressed?
Are there specific beha vior management str ategies that are particularly
effectiv e for students with special needs, and how can inclusiv e classrooms
be fostered?
What proactiv e measures can teachers tak e to prev ent beha vior issues
before they arise in the classroom?
 
 
In my investigation, I h ypothesiz e that as teachers, we commonly encounter
challenges in implementing beha vior management str ategies, which ma y
include issues related to student beha vior, limited resources, and time
constr aints. I anticipate that tailored professional dev elopment and
collabor ative approaches in volving administr ators and support staff can
address these challenges effectiv ely. Regarding students with special needs,
I expect that beha vior management str ategies customiz ed to meet their
diverse needs, along with inclusiv e classroom en vironments char acteriz ed by
acceptance and support, will yield positiv e outcomes. Furthermore, I
propose that proactiv e measures such as establishing clear expectations,
building positiv e relationships, and integr ating social-emotional learning
activities into the curriculum can prev ent beha vior issues before they arise. I
anticipate that in volving parents/guardians in beha vior management
strategies and interv entions will enhance the effectiv eness of these proactiv e
measures. My research aims to v alidate these h ypotheses and pro vide
actionable insights to support effectiv e beha vior management pr actices in
early childhood education settings.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Behavior management in early childhood education is a well-researched area
encompassing a wide r ange of str ategies to promote positiv e beha vior and
create supportiv e learning en vironments. Historically , the field has ev olved
from punitiv e approaches to discipline to more proactiv e and positiv e
behavior support str ategies. Early research in this area often emphasiz ed
behavior modification techniques, such as tok en economies and punishment -
based str ategies. Still, contempor ary approaches emphasiz e the importance
of prev entive measures, positiv e reinforcement, and social-emotional
learning (Simonsen et al. , 2008).
 
The contextual history of this subject area is shaped b y various theoretical
frameworks and research par adigms. Early beha viorist theories, such as
those proposed b y B.F. Skinner , laid the groundwork for understanding the
principles of beha vior change and reinforcement (Skinner , 1953). Howev er,
criticisms of beha viorism led to the dev elopment of more holistic
approaches, including social learning theory and ecological systems theory ,
which emphasiz e the inter action between individuals and their en vironments
in shaping beha vior (Bandur a, 1977).
 
Building upon the body of extant knowledge, recent research has focused on
identif ying evidence-based pr actices for promoting positiv e beha vior in early
childhood settings. This includes str ategies such as classroom- wide positiv e
behavior interv entions and supports (PBIS), social-emotional learning (SEL)
progr ams, and tr auma-informed approaches (Simonsen et al. , 2008).
Additionally , there is growing recognition of the importance of cultur al
responsiv eness and equit y in beha vior management pr actices, as well as the
need for collabor ation between teachers, families, and support professionals.
 
My current study seeks to contribute to this body of knowledge b y exploring
the effectiv eness of beha vior management str ategies in real- world early
childhood education settings. By examining the challenges faced b y
teachers, identif ying str ategies that resonate with educators, and exploring
proactiv e measures for prev enting beha vior issues, m y research aims to
inform the dev elopment of evidence-based pr actices conduciv e to creating
supportiv e and inclusiv e learning en vironments for y oung children. Through
a mix ed-methods approach, including surv eys and interviews, this study
builds upon existing research b y providing nuanced insights into the pr actical
application, challenges, and outcomes associated with beha vior management
strategies in early childhood education.

motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The motiv ation behind this study stems from the recognition of the significant
challenges posed b y traditional punitiv e disciplinary approaches in educational
settings, particularly concerning their disproportionate impact on marginaliz ed
students. The escalation of ex clusionary discipline pr actices o ver the y ears has not
only failed to address underlying beha vioral issues effectiv ely but has also
exacerbated disparities in educational outcomes and perpetuated the school-to-
prison pipeline, especially for Black and Latine children. In response to these
concerns, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternativ e disciplinary
methods such as restor ative justice (RJ) pr actices, which prioritiz e repairing harm,
fostering dialogue, and building relationships within the school communit y. Despite
the increasing adoption of RJ in schools, there remains a critical gap in quantitativ e
evidence regarding its effectiv eness and potential benefits. Therefore, this study
seeks to fill this gap b y rigorously examining the impacts of restor ative practices on
student outcomes, school climate perceptions, and engagement with the criminal
legal system, utilizing data from a large-scale implementation within the Chicago
Public Schools system. By pro viding credible estimates of the effects of RP
progr amming, this research aims to inform policy and pr actice in education, offering
insights into a promising approach that ma y mitigate the need for punitiv e
disciplinary measures while promoting positiv e student experiences and academic
success for all.
Since schools that receiv ed RP progr amming differ on v arious dimensions when
compared to schools that did not, we emplo y a difference-in-differences-st yle
research design that relies on a weak er conditional ex ogeneit y assumption requiring
that expected changes o ver time in outcomes absent treatment are independent of
RP progr amming assignment.
Our preliminary  evidence suggests that the introduction of RP in CPS high schools
reduced the number of out -of-school suspension da ys,  reduced the number of
student arrests and impro ved  perceiv ed school climate, suggesting genuine
changes in underlying student beha viors and attitudes.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The United States justice system is often viewed as one of the most punitiv e in the
world.An estimated 1 in 20 Americans will be incarcer ated in State or F ederal prison
at some point in their life and o ver 2.3 million people are currently occup ying our
federal, state,and local jails and prisons, costing our go vernment up to $33,274 per
individual in 2015.
Furthermore, man y of those incarcer ated are for non- violent offenses, suggesting
that
the cost to individuals and societ y may be a voidable. In recent y ears, there has
been a
movement a way from punitiv e policies as they do not appear to reduce recidivism,
nor
lead to changed beha viors, particularly for y outh. In Illinois, the Department of
Juvenile
Justice has already tak en increasing measures to “right -size” their population b y
limiting
youth’s contact with the system on the front end and pro viding more in-facilit y
education and support for y outh. 
There is suggestiv e evidence that schools can pro vide broad support for y outh in a
manner that ma y reduce lik elihood of criminal justice in volvement in future y ears.
School districts, including Chicago Public Schools (CPS), ha ve been experimenting
with restor ative practices and skills coaching that incorpor ate proactiv e approaches
to dev eloping beha vior through curricula aimed at dev eloping socioemotional skills.
These interv entions tak e varied forms, and often are embodied in progr ams such as
Second Step , which incorpor ates socioemotional learning into the mainstream
curriculum. In addition to these inno vative approaches, the CPS Student Code of
Conduct w as revised first in 2012 and then in 2014 to impose greater restrictions
on the set of infr actions that can result in ex clusionary disciplinary methods.
Below are the research questions:
What is the impact of introducing restor ative practices (e.g. , peer juries, peace
rooms, mediation circles, etc.) in schools?
How did the 2012/2014 changes in the set of infr actions that could result in
exclusionary disciplinary methods impact student/school outcomes related to
school climate, achiev ement, discipline, and criminalit y?
How restor ative practices continues to be implemented in Schools
We use the administr ation data to answer the first two questions and plan to
undergo qualitativ e data collection including surv eys and interviews to answer the
third question.
To explore how R estorative Practices in CPS affect students, we focus on the
followingstudent -level outcomes:
Academic and beha vioral outcomes such as GP A, math and reading
standardiz ed test scores, attendance, disciplinary infr actions, and social and
emotional learning
Involvement with crime as measured b y the number of and t ypes of arrests.
We will share our results of this restor ative practice analysis with Chicago
Public Schools, Chicago P olice Department, and other k ey communit y
stakeholders. W e are planning to publish the final results of the analysis in a
peer-reviewed journal.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject.
What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build
upon the body of extant knowledge?
Classroom management and discipline represent one of the hardest parts of school
officials’ jobs (Ev ertson and W einstein, 2006; K auffman et al. , 2011). Ov er the last
five decades, educational authorities ha ve increasingly turned to using ex clusionary
discipline, with the r ate of school suspensions more than doubling for Black and
Latine children since 1974 (Losen, Martinez et al. , 2020).1 In school y ear (SY)
2012, appro ximately 3.5 million public school students were suspended from school,
losing nearly 18 million da ys of instruction due to “z ero-toler ance” policies (Losen et
al., 2015). Being in a stricter school can lead to long-term negativ e consequences
such as decreased educational attainment, increased misconduct, and increased
likelihood of engaging with the criminal legal system (F abelo et al. , 2011;
Shollenberger , 2015; W olf and K upchik, 2017; Bacher -Hicks, Billings and Deming,
2019). One justification for policies encour aging more punitiv e discipline is the
desire to prev ent negativ e spillo ver effects from disruptiv e students that mak e it
hard for other students to learn. This concern has led districts to approach conflict
resolution from a z ero-sum perspectiv e: suspend students whom they view as
disruptiv e in an effort to hold them accountable and potentially harm those
students, or a void suspensions and harm their classmates whose learning now ma y
be disrupted. While educators are increasingly a ware of the potential harms of
suspensions, they seek concrete responses to undesir able beha vior, particularly in a
context where 80 percent of schools report ha ving incidents of violence, theft, or
other crimes (Griffith and T yner, 2019; W ang et al. , 2020). Indeed, o ver two-thirds
of parents and teachers ha ve historically offered strong support for the
establishment of z ero-toler ance policies to promote accountabilit y (Public Agenda
Foundation, 2004). In recent y ears, a small but growing mo vement within education
has sought to find a solution that a voids this tr adeoff b y deterring undesir able
behavior without imparting harm. In our study , we in vestigate one such alternativ e:
restor ative justice (RJ) pr actices, which emphasiz e communit y building and
restitution or restor ation, as an alternativ e to the tr aditional punitiv e approach
(Losen, Hewitt and T oldson, 2014). RJ as a philosoph y emphasiz es the repar ation of
harm between victims and offenders, engaging v arious stak eholders in the
communit y through open dialogue and shared ownership of disciplinary justice with
the goal of restoring (or tr ansforming) relationships and fostering long-term
repar ative approaches to conflict resolution (McCold and W achtel, 1998; Fulk erson,
2001; K arp and Breslin, 2001; McGarrell, 2001; Hopkins, 2003; Gonz´alez, 2012;
Angel et al. , 2014; W adhwa, 2015; Winn, 2016; A ugustine et al. , 2018; Gregory et
al., 2018; Acosta et al. , 2019; Shem Hereafter , we refer to Black or African
American children as Black children and Latine/a/o or Hispanic children as Latine
children. 1 T ov, Raphael and Sk og, 2024; Minow , 2022). While RJ has entered U .S.
public education systems only recently in the form of restor ative practices (RP), it
has quickly increased in use despite the lack of quantitativ e evidence on the
associated costs and benefits. Studies on the impacts of RP on educational and
behavioral outcomes, within or outside of schools, are informativ e but limited with
most being correlational or descriptiv e. This study pro vides credible estimates of the
effects of RP progr amming from the largest scale school-based interv ention studied
to date","and Student/Staff Involvement

We use administr ative  data to estimate the impact of R estorative Practices on
students educational and beha vioral outcomes and will conduct primary data
collection to understand implementation.
Primary data collection including interviews and surv eys will be conducted:
Staff Interviews: The research team plans to conduct 25 one-hour interviews with
staff from r andomly selected CPS schools that ha ve implemented R estorative
Practices (RP). The Interviews ma y be conducted in-person or remote. These
interviews aim to delv e into the staff members' experiences with RP
implementation, their perspectiv es on RP , and whether the effects of RP ha ve
persisted or w aned within their respectiv e schools. As a tok en of appreciation and
recognition for their time, staff participants will be offered a $50 gift card.
Surveys: Online surv eys will be conducted with selected staff in 73 schools who
have implemented R estorative Practices in their schools. 15 surv eys will be
conducted per school. 
The surv ey will tak e appro x 15 minutes to complete. School staff will be in vited via

Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
The research methodology is primarily focused on ev aluating the causal effect of
Restorative Practices (RP) progr amming on v arious student outcomes within the
Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system. The study utiliz es a quasi-experimental
design known as difference-in-differences (DID) to estimate the impact of RP
exposure on student outcomes.
Here's an o verview of the research methodology and analytical techniques used:
Difference-in-Differences (DID) Design: This research emplo ys a DID-st yle design
to compare changes in outcomes o ver time between schools that implemented RP
progr amming and those that did not. The fundamental assumption underlying this
design is that, in the absence of RP progr amming, the treated and untreated groups
would ha ve followed par allel trends in outcomes o ver time.
Addressing T reatment Effect Heterogeneit y: The study acknowledges potential
heterogeneit y in treatment effects o ver time and across groups due to factors such
as cumulativ e exposure, ev olving disciplinary pr actices, and refinement of RP
progr amming. T o address this, the research emplo ys an estimator deriv ed from de
Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2020), which is designed to produce unbiased
estimates of treatment effects ev en in the presence of such heterogeneit y.
Event Study Fr amework: Ev ent study plots are utiliz ed to ev aluate the par allel
trends assumption, which is crucial for the v alidity of the DID design. These plots
examine how outcomes ev olve relativ e to the timing of RP exposure, both
instantaneously and dynamically .
Control V ariables: V arious student -level covariates are included in the analysis to
impro ve the precision of estimates and account for potential confounding factors.
These co variates include age, cohort, gender , race, unhoused status, English
Learner status, disabilit y classification, and eligibilit y for free or reduced-price lunch.
Clustering Standard Errors: Giv en that treatment is assigned at the school lev el,
standard errors are clustered at the school lev el to account for potential correlation
of outcomes within schools.
Combining Estimates: Finally , the study combines estimates of instantaneous and
dynamic effects of RP exposure to produce a single estimate of the causal effect of
treatment on the treated for each outcome of interest.
Overall, the research methodology described here aims to rigorously assess the
impact of RP progr amming within CPS , taking into account potential sources of bias
and heterogeneit y in treatment effects."

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
OneGoal partnered with the Inclusiv e Econom y Lab to conduct a r andomiz ed
controlled trial (RCT) analyzing the impact of student participation in
OneGoal on college enrollment, persistence, and gr aduation, as well as high
school outcomes (including GP A, SAT scores, and noncognitiv e skills). In the
prior application/amendment appro ved July 22nd 2021, we requested and
receiv ed permission to 1) conduct surv ey research with former CPS students
in summer 2021, and 2) interview principals/college counselors and teachers
at the schools participating in the OneGoal research ev aluation in SY2021
and SY2022. In September 2022, we receiv ed permission to extend this
research for another w ave of the study , now inclusiv e of the gr aduating class
of 2022 who were participating in the RCT , as well as additional interviews
with school staff at participating study schools throughout SY2023. In this
application (10/2023), we are requesting more time to speak with principals
and progr am directors of Cohort 2022 b y extending the interview timeline
through March 2024. By supplementing our quantitativ e analysis and
capturing qualitativ e feedback of the OneGoal progr am directly from those
administering it, we hope to pro vide a more comprehensiv e view of the
progr am's impact.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Note: No change from 2021 application. After testing the survey, if it takes
too long to complete we may cut some questions that address some
research questions above.)
SENIOR SURVEY
Senior Survey Research purpose : Results of this surv ey will help
contextualiz e the RCT outcomes, clarif ying which non-cognitiv e skills
OneGoal impacts most, how supports for OneGoal students differed from the
control group , and how the pandemic affected postsecondary decisions.
Senior Survey Research Question 1 : Are OneGoal F ellows more lik ely
than students in the control group to demonstr ate the non-cognitiv e skills
and college-readiness mindset associated with college success?
Hypothesis 1 : OneGoal’ s intense focus on building non-cognitiv e skills
leads us to h ypothesiz e that students enrolled in OneGoal will be more lik ely
to report higher lev els of such skills (lik e grit, belief in a growth mindset,
and college-readiness) than control group students who ma y not ha ve
receiv ed such focused prepar ation.
Senior Survey Research Question 2 : Are OneGoal F ellows more lik ely
than students in the control group to feel they had access to college
application and financial aid resources and supports?
Hypothesis 2 : OneGoal’ s intense focus on supporting the entire college
application process, with the explicit goal of succeeding in college, leads us
to hypothesiz e that OneGoal F ellows are lik elier to feel they had support
through the college application and financial aid process, and to be lik elier to
use those resources.
Senior Survey Research Question 3 : How did the pandemic influence
students’ decisions about attending college in the next academic y ear? Did
this differ between OneGoal F ellows and the control group?
Hypothesis 3 : We hypothesiz e that, whereas control group students
without access to OneGoal ma y have had fewer touchpoints with college
counselors and other resources focused on applying to college, OneGoal
Fellows will ha ve had more support and therefore be more lik ely to remain
encour aged to continue with the college application process and pursue a
postsecondary degree.
ALUMNI SURVEY
Alumni Survey Research purpose:  We plan to surv ey students who were
part of the OneGoal ev aluation and were expected to gr aduate high school in
2020. This surv ey is meant to learn about students’ adaptation to college
(among college- attendees) or their alternate plans (for the non- attendees),
as well as to understand how they adapted in the first y ear out of high
school. This will help us to understand how well OneGoal prepared theirfellows for the postsecondary tr ansition and supported them in the first y ear
after high school.
Alumni Survey Research Question 1: Among students who attended
college, what is the OneGoal effect on students’ experience of the tr ansition
and first y ear of college?
Hypothesis 1 : OneGoal’ s intense focus on preparing students for the realit y
of college, coupled with their continued support for students during the first
year after high school, leads us to h ypothesiz e that OneGoal F ellows will be
more lik ely to indicate that they receiv ed support during their first y ear out
of high school and will be more lik ely to ha ve adapted to college compared
to the control group .
Alumni Survey Research Question 2 : Are OneGoal F ellows more lik ely
than students in the control group to demonstr ate a commitment to earning
a 4-year college degree? Does this hold whether or not they attended
college immediately after high school?
Hypothesis 2 : OneGoal’ s strong focus on the v alue of a 4- year college
degree leads us to h ypothesiz e that OneGoal F ellows are more lik ely to
demonstr ate an intent to earn a college degree in the near or long-term.
Alumni Survey Research Question 3:  Among students who did not attend
college in the academic y ear after gr aduating high school, are OneGoal
Fellows more lik ely than students in the control group to demonstr ate a
sense of confidence and autonom y about their life goals and future?
Hypothesis 3 : We hypothesiz e that OneGoal F ellows are more lik ely to
demonstr ate a sense of autonom y and confidence about their future.
Alumni Survey Research Question 4:  How did the pandemic affect
students’ experiences during the last academic y ear? Are OneGoal F ellows
more lik ely than students in the control group to feel they had a support
system in the y ear after high school gr aduation?
Hypothesis 4 : Because the OneGoal progr am runs through the fall one y ear
after high school gr aduation (for college attendees, the first da y of students’
sophomore y ear), we h ypothesiz e that OneGoal F ellows will be more lik ely to
indicate that they receiv ed additional support than non-F ellows, and will
therefore feel more motiv ated to continue pursuing their postsecondary
goals despite the disruption of the pandemic.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Note: No change from 2021 application.
Research tells us that a college degree can support socioeconomic mobilit y.
Howev er, students from low -income backgrounds face systematic barriers to
college and gr aduate at lower r ates than students from wealthier families
(Chett y et al. , 2017). As a result of decades of segregationist and r acist
policy , the US has seen a growing achiev ement gap between affluent and
poor children, disproportionately students of color (Duncan & Murnane,
2011). This limits access to selectiv e colleges which pro vide more student
supports and ha ve higher gr aduation r ates. So , students from low incomes
backgrounds are less lik ely to attain a college degree, compounding
socioeconomic inequalit y (Bowen et al. , 2009; Chett y et al. , 2017b). This
challenge is particularly acute in Chicago: while more than 69 percent of CPS
freshmen aspire to earn a bachelor ’s degree, it is estimated that only 19
percent will do so within 10 y ears of starting high school (Nagaoka &
Seeskin, 2018). Low enrollment and gr aduation r ates are driv en by man y
challenges bey ond academic preparedness, including: underdev eloped
social/emotional readiness for college, difficult y navigating the college
application and financial aid process, and difficult y navigating the tr ansition
itself.
These are the challenges OneGoal aims to address. There is a growing body
of evidence on the effectiv eness of multi-faceted progr ams that address
each of the barriers students face in their journey to and through college.
For example, P age et al. (2017) examine the effectiv eness of the Dell
Scholars progr am, a comprehensiv e progr am combining direct financial
supports with individualiz ed advising, and find that it increases college
graduation r ates b y 25 percent. A r andomiz ed controlled trial of Bottom Line,
another support progr am spanning high school and college, found that it
increased enrollment b y 10 percentage points and persistence to the second
year by 8 percentage points (Barr & Castleman, 2017).  Evidence from other
comprehensiv e progr ams aimed at lower performing students ha ve seen
promising results (Scriv ener et al. , 2015; Sommo et al. , 2018; Bertr and et
al, 2019; Bettinger and Bak er, 2011).
In addition to the importance of supporting students through the college
application process, a growing body of research has found that non-cognitiv e
skills (lik e grit, self -efficacy , and resilience) are predictiv e increased test
scores and long-term success in educational attainment and economic
mobilit y (Borghans et al. , 2008; Heckman & K autz, 2012). R esearch also
suggests that adolescents who grow up in disadv antaged en vironments can
experience positiv e long-term outcomes when they participate in
interv entions that target non-cognitiv e skills and offer mentoring and
guidance (K autz et al. , 2014). More specifically , Duckworth et al. (2007) find
that grit is correlated with educational attainment including higher
undergr aduate GP As. Yeager & Dweck (2012) find that students can be
encour aged to dev elop a growth mindset and learn the tools to o vercomechallenges, leading them to become more resilient and better positioned to
handle challenging school tr ansitions. R esearch also suggests that schools
with a college-going culture (with explicit con versations and encour agement
from school staff lik e counselors and teachers) help promote college
enrollment (Kim & Núñez, 2013; Bry an et al. , 2017). Heckman and K autz
(2014) argue that non-cognitiv e skills are crucial to long-term economic
success and that there is a knowledge gap in ev aluations of interv entions
specific to adolescents, which we hope to redress in including this surv ey
component in our OneGoal ev aluation.

With RRB permission to conduct student surv eys and staff interviews, we
have, to date, sent out surv eys to Cohort 2020 alumni, Cohort 2021 seniors,
Cohort 2021 alumni, and Cohort 2022 seniors. W e have also conducted staff
interviews with school principals and OneGoal progr am directors in Cohorts
2020, 2021, and 2022. The purpose of this amendment is to request an
extended interview timeline for the progr am director and principal
interviews, through March 2024, to allow us to continue collecting qualitativ e
feedback on the OneGoal progr am.
View xForm - Research Review Board (RRB) SubmissionPreliminary Results to Date
Preliminary results from the alumni surv eys indicated that while it w as still
difficult to connect to teachers and peers in an online setting, alumni v alued
the support they receiv ed from their OneGoal coach as they tr ansitioned to
college. OneGoal alumni were also slightly more lik ely to ha ve more frequent
support during and after high school compared to their control group peers.
In surv ey responses from current students, OneGoal w as frequently cited for
having helpful teachers, strong college supports, and for allowing students
to prepare for a path after gr aduation.
In preliminary results from progr am director and principal interviews,
OneGoal w as similarly viewed positiv ely, but staff also shared feedback on
where the progr am could impro ve. Principals v alued the w ay OneGoal's
curriculum focused on personal explor ation and allows students to choose
the best postsecondary path for them, and also v alued the pr actical support
OneGoal pro vides throughout the college application process. Progr am
directors v alued OneGoal's multi- year fr amework for allowing them to build
trust and relationships with their students, and v alued OneGoal's resources
and internal support. Howev er, given that the pandemic influenced students'
college-going plans and increased interest in alternativ e path ways, principals
and progr am directors both agreed that the curriculum could be more
inclusiv e of non-college path ways, in addition to ha ving stronger supports
for socio-emotional learning and communit y-building.

In order to measure the contr ast between control group students and
OneGoal students in terms of their non-cognitiv e skills and the support they
receiv ed during the college application process, we plan to in vite all study
participants to tak e a surv ey after completing their senior y ear of high
school and one y ear after they are expected to gr aduate from high school.
We will link surv ey responses to the secondary data we’v e previously been
appro ved to use (such as CPS master file records, NSC enrollment records,
etc.). This will allow us to tr ack how surv ey responses differ based on
student char acteristics such as demogr aphics or college enrollment status.
We include this disclosure in the student and parent consent form, as well as
the surv ey invitation email to students.
Population: ~200 former CPS students in the class of 2022 receiving the
senior surv ey, and ~670 former CPS students in the class of 2021 receiving
the alumni surv ey, across 18 CPS high schools (including 4 charter schools).
These students were part of the o verall OneGoal progr am ev aluation. W e will
exclude certain students (see Ex clusion criteria).
Survey length & incentiv e: 10-20 minutes. Students who complete the
survey in Phase 1, before re-launching with the new incentiv e plan, will be
entered into a lottery to win $100 incentiv e. Students who do not win the
lottery will still receiv e a $30 incentiv e. Students who complete the surv ey in
Phase 2, after re-launching with the new incentiv e plan, will get a
guaranteed $30 incentiv e.
Survey questions: All questions will be optional. Some questions require an
answer for br anching into different sections of the surv ey – in these
questions, there will be a “Prefer not to answer ” option. F or the senior
survey, the surv ey will also pro vide them the option to share a non-CPS
email address for a follow -up surv ey one y ear after gr aduating, and will
specif y that this follow -up is also completely v oluntary .
Data collection method: Qualtrics, securely hosted b y the Univ ersity of
Chicago .
Recruitment Method 1: Mail a postcard to home address
The Inclusiv e Econom y Lab will send study participants a postcard to their
home address with an in vitation to participate in the online surv ey (including
a surv ey link / QR code). Our approach also includes at least 2 ph ysical
postcard reminders mailed to students’ homes (reminders will ex clude
students who ha ve already responded to the surv ey). F or the 2022 round,
we will not contact an y minor students and therefore we will not require
parent consent.
Recruitment Method 2: Emailing non-CPS email addresses
Additionally , we ha ve previously gotten appro val from CPS via SOW 40 to
analyz e the CPS senior exit questionnaire to pull students' non-CPS email
addresses, as well as summer melt tr acker information housed within
Naviance. F or the senior surv ey (sent to recent 2022 gr aduates), we shouldreceiv e this information via the routine SEQ data deliv ery to IEL. Depending
on whether we receiv e contact information in time, we plan to send this
senior surv ey directly to the email addresses within a few months of
graduation, which would supplement the mailed postcard method described
in the previous par agraph. Use of this method ultimately depends on CPS
appro val and consider ations about the timing for releasing those emails to
us. For the alumni surv ey (sent to 2021 gr aduates, who receiv ed the senior
survey in summer 2021), we will continue to use the email addresses we
were appro ved to use last y ear (and appro ved to re-use for the alumni
survey this y ear), but we will not re-contact an y student who completed the
survey last y ear and opted out of being re-contacted.
In summer 2022, per CPS guidance, we anticipate charter schools who ha ve
executed data sharing agreements with us to pro vide home/email address
contact information for their students since CPS data is incomplete for
charter school alumni. W e may also reach some students via their OneGoal
progr am email addresses (for students who were in the treatment/OneGoal
class) as a w ay to maximiz e response r ate, pending partners' data sharing
agreement.
Timeline (modified): No vember 2022 through January 2023 (~10-12 weeks
post RRB appro val). W e plan at least 2 reminders of the student surv eys
spaced appro ximately 1 week after the initial w ave of in vitations has gone
out. W e may include additional reminders, depending on response r ate,
about once per 1-2 weeks. Modification: W e fielded the surv eys in No vember
to a low response r ate, so we plan to re-launch the surv ey, ideally in
December ahead of the winter break, with an updated incentiv e plan, and
leave it open through the end of January .
(Note: All references to the number of gift cards / chance of winning are
pending final budget. All references to timeline are pending final RRB
appro vals and ma y be adjusted to allow for a ~10- week fielding window . All
references to surv ey length will fall within the 10-20 minute r ange, but we
will cut questions from the surv ey and then test the new progr amming
before finalizing language.)
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
Student emails and home addresses, as well as surv ey responses, are
captured and stored via Univ ersity-maintained resources, primarily Bo x and
Qualtrics. Please see a detailed description of our data securit y practices at
each stage (receiving contact information, fielding surv eys, capturing
responses, and disbursing incentiv es) in the ""P ermission, Confidentialit y, and

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
OneGoal partnered with the Inclusiv e Econom y Lab to conduct a r andomiz ed
controlled trial (RCT) analyzing the impact of student participation in
OneGoal on college enrollment, persistence, and gr aduation, as well as high
school outcomes (including GP A, SAT scores, and noncognitiv e skills). In the
prior application/amendment appro ved July 22nd 2021, we requested and
receiv ed permission to 1) conduct surv ey research with former CPS students
in summer 2021, and 2) interview principals/college counselors and teachers
at the schools participating in the OneGoal research ev aluation in SY2021
and SY2022. In September 2022, we receiv ed permission to extend this
research for another w ave of the study , now inclusiv e of the gr aduating class
of 2022 who were participating in the RCT , as well as additional interviews
with school staff at participating study schools throughout SY2023. In this
application (10/2023), we are requesting more time to speak with principals
and progr am directors of Cohort 2022 b y extending the interview timeline
through March 2024. By supplementing our quantitativ e analysis and
capturing qualitativ e feedback of the OneGoal progr am directly from those
administering it, we hope to pro vide a more comprehensiv e view of the
progr am's impact.Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Note: No change from 2021 application. After testing the survey, if it takes
too long to complete we may cut some questions that address some
research questions above.)
SENIOR SURVEY
Senior Survey Research purpose : Results of this surv ey will help
contextualiz e the RCT outcomes, clarif ying which non-cognitiv e skills
OneGoal impacts most, how supports for OneGoal students differed from the
control group , and how the pandemic affected postsecondary decisions.
Senior Survey Research Question 1 : Are OneGoal F ellows more lik ely
than students in the control group to demonstr ate the non-cognitiv e skills
and college-readiness mindset associated with college success?
Hypothesis 1 : OneGoal’ s intense focus on building non-cognitiv e skills
leads us to h ypothesiz e that students enrolled in OneGoal will be more lik ely
to report higher lev els of such skills (lik e grit, belief in a growth mindset,
and college-readiness) than control group students who ma y not ha ve
receiv ed such focused prepar ation.
Senior Survey Research Question 2 : Are OneGoal F ellows more lik ely
than students in the control group to feel they had access to college
application and financial aid resources and supports?
Hypothesis 2 : OneGoal’ s intense focus on supporting the entire college
application process, with the explicit goal of succeeding in college, leads us
to hypothesiz e that OneGoal F ellows are lik elier to feel they had support
through the college application and financial aid process, and to be lik elier to
use those resources.
Senior Survey Research Question 3 : How did the pandemic influence
students’ decisions about attending college in the next academic y ear? Did
this differ between OneGoal F ellows and the control group?
Hypothesis 3 : We hypothesiz e that, whereas control group students
without access to OneGoal ma y have had fewer touchpoints with college
counselors and other resources focused on applying to college, OneGoal
Fellows will ha ve had more support and therefore be more lik ely to remain
encour aged to continue with the college application process and pursue a
postsecondary degree.
ALUMNI SURVEY
Alumni Survey Research purpose:  We plan to surv ey students who were
part of the OneGoal ev aluation and were expected to gr aduate high school in
2020. This surv ey is meant to learn about students’ adaptation to college
(among college- attendees) or their alternate plans (for the non- attendees),
as well as to understand how they adapted in the first y ear out of high
school. This will help us to understand how well OneGoal prepared theirfellows for the postsecondary tr ansition and supported them in the first y ear
after high school.
Alumni Survey Research Question 1: Among students who attended
college, what is the OneGoal effect on students’ experience of the tr ansition
and first y ear of college?
Hypothesis 1 : OneGoal’ s intense focus on preparing students for the realit y
of college, coupled with their continued support for students during the first
year after high school, leads us to h ypothesiz e that OneGoal F ellows will be
more lik ely to indicate that they receiv ed support during their first y ear out
of high school and will be more lik ely to ha ve adapted to college compared
to the control group .
Alumni Survey Research Question 2 : Are OneGoal F ellows more lik ely
than students in the control group to demonstr ate a commitment to earning
a 4-year college degree? Does this hold whether or not they attended
college immediately after high school?
Hypothesis 2 : OneGoal’ s strong focus on the v alue of a 4- year college
degree leads us to h ypothesiz e that OneGoal F ellows are more lik ely to
demonstr ate an intent to earn a college degree in the near or long-term.
Alumni Survey Research Question 3:  Among students who did not attend
college in the academic y ear after gr aduating high school, are OneGoal
Fellows more lik ely than students in the control group to demonstr ate a
sense of confidence and autonom y about their life goals and future?
Hypothesis 3 : We hypothesiz e that OneGoal F ellows are more lik ely to
demonstr ate a sense of autonom y and confidence about their future.
Alumni Survey Research Question 4:  How did the pandemic affect
students’ experiences during the last academic y ear? Are OneGoal F ellows
more lik ely than students in the control group to feel they had a support
system in the y ear after high school gr aduation?
Hypothesis 4 : Because the OneGoal progr am runs through the fall one y ear
after high school gr aduation (for college attendees, the first da y of students’
sophomore y ear), we h ypothesiz e that OneGoal F ellows will be more lik ely to
indicate that they receiv ed additional support than non-F ellows, and will
therefore feel more motiv ated to continue pursuing their postsecondary
goals despite the disruption of the pandemic.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Note: No change from 2021 application.
Research tells us that a college degree can support socioeconomic mobilit y.
Howev er, students from low -income backgrounds face systematic barriers to
college and gr aduate at lower r ates than students from wealthier families
(Chett y et al. , 2017). As a result of decades of segregationist and r acist
policy , the US has seen a growing achiev ement gap between affluent and
poor children, disproportionately students of color (Duncan & Murnane,
2011). This limits access to selectiv e colleges which pro vide more student
supports and ha ve higher gr aduation r ates. So , students from low incomes
backgrounds are less lik ely to attain a college degree, compounding
socioeconomic inequalit y (Bowen et al. , 2009; Chett y et al. , 2017b). This
challenge is particularly acute in Chicago: while more than 69 percent of CPS
freshmen aspire to earn a bachelor ’s degree, it is estimated that only 19
percent will do so within 10 y ears of starting high school (Nagaoka &
Seeskin, 2018). Low enrollment and gr aduation r ates are driv en by man y
challenges bey ond academic preparedness, including: underdev eloped
social/emotional readiness for college, difficult y navigating the college
application and financial aid process, and difficult y navigating the tr ansition
itself.
These are the challenges OneGoal aims to address. There is a growing body
of evidence on the effectiv eness of multi-faceted progr ams that address
each of the barriers students face in their journey to and through college.
For example, P age et al. (2017) examine the effectiv eness of the Dell
Scholars progr am, a comprehensiv e progr am combining direct financial
supports with individualiz ed advising, and find that it increases college
graduation r ates b y 25 percent. A r andomiz ed controlled trial of Bottom Line,
another support progr am spanning high school and college, found that it
increased enrollment b y 10 percentage points and persistence to the second
year by 8 percentage points (Barr & Castleman, 2017).  Evidence from other
comprehensiv e progr ams aimed at lower performing students ha ve seen
promising results (Scriv ener et al. , 2015; Sommo et al. , 2018; Bertr and et
al, 2019; Bettinger and Bak er, 2011).
In addition to the importance of supporting students through the college
application process, a growing body of research has found that non-cognitiv e
skills (lik e grit, self -efficacy , and resilience) are predictiv e increased test
scores and long-term success in educational attainment and economic
mobilit y (Borghans et al. , 2008; Heckman & K autz, 2012). R esearch also
suggests that adolescents who grow up in disadv antaged en vironments can
experience positiv e long-term outcomes when they participate in
interv entions that target non-cognitiv e skills and offer mentoring and
guidance (K autz et al. , 2014). More specifically , Duckworth et al. (2007) find
that grit is correlated with educational attainment including higher
undergr aduate GP As. Yeager & Dweck (2012) find that students can be
encour aged to dev elop a growth mindset and learn the tools to o vercomechallenges, leading them to become more resilient and better positioned to
handle challenging school tr ansitions. R esearch also suggests that schools
with a college-going culture (with explicit con versations and encour agement
from school staff lik e counselors and teachers) help promote college
enrollment (Kim & Núñez, 2013; Bry an et al. , 2017). Heckman and K autz
(2014) argue that non-cognitiv e skills are crucial to long-term economic
success and that there is a knowledge gap in ev aluations of interv entions
specific to adolescents, which we hope to redress in including this surv ey
component in our OneGoal ev aluation.

Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
 
STUDENT SURVEYS:
Note: No change from 2021 application except that we will no longer contact
minors under 18 and therefore do not need to seek parental consent.
Please see detailed protocol in Funding and Intervention Information  section,
 “Please outline y our protocol for surv ey activities, describing when, where,
duration, frequency , and with whom. ” Brief summary below:
Timeline : Timeline (modified): No vember 2022 through January 2023
(~10-12 weeks post RRB appro val). 
Research Method : A surv ey sent to ~670 Class of 2021 (alumni surv ey)
and ~200 Class of 2022 (senior surv ey) students who are part of the o verall
OneGoal progr am ev aluation.
Survey questions: All questions will be optional. Some questions require
an answer for br anching into different sections of the surv ey – in these
questions, there will be a “Prefer not to answer ” option. F or the senior
survey, the surv ey will also pro vide them the option to share a non-CPS
email address for a follow -up surv ey one y ear after gr aduating, and will
specif y that this follow -up is also completely v oluntary .
Data collection method: Qualtrics, securely hosted b y the Univ ersity of
Chicago .
Recruitment Method 1:  Mail a postcard to home address
We will in vite students to tak e the surv ey by mailing postcards directly to
their home. Our approach also includes at least 2 ph ysical postcard
reminders mailed to students’ homes (reminders will ex clude students who
have already responded to the surv ey).
Recruitment Method 2: Emailing non-CPS email addresses
Pending the appropriate permissions and access from CPS , OneGoal, and
charter schools, we will contact seniors and alumni students directly via
email. Our approach includes at least 2 email reminders (reminders will
exclude students who ha ve already responded to the surv ey).
 
STAFF INTERVIEWS:Note: The below is the same as the Funding and Intervention Information
section, “Please outline y our protocol for individual interview activities,
describing when, where, dur ation, frequency , and with whom. ”
Research purpose:  Understand principal’ s or college counselor's
experience with and impression of the OneGoal progr am, other college
prepar ation services and supports offered, and OneGoal instructor ’s
experience with the OneGoal curriculum and their students’ engagement,
particularly during the pandemic.
Timeline : Ongoing (summer/fall 2022, winter/spring of 2023) at staff ’s
convenience.
Population : ~15 principals/counselors and ~20 teachers
Interview length & incentive : 30-45 minutes for principals, 20 minutes
for teachers, conducted at staff ’s convenience during business hours. No
compensation will be pro vided for these interviews as per CPS policy .","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
For teacher interviews, we plan to summariz e interview notes through
synthesizing common themes across teachers.
For student surv eys, final sample siz e as well as internal funding resources
will determine how rigorous our analytical technique can be. As we did not
achiev e a high response r ate in the first w ave and don't anticipate a high
response r ate this summer , we will lik ely be limited to basic descriptiv e
summaries of common themes shared in students' open-ended surv ey
responses, as well as basic statistics on the close-ended scale questions,
comparing responses from students who participated in OneGoal vs. the
control group . If our budget allows us to dev ote the staff time, we ma y do
more analysis such as weighting responses b y certain char acteristics or
accounting for non-response bias. And if we find that we ha ve enough
sample, we ma y conduct more rigorous analysis such as R asch surv ey
modeling. Depending on our later analyses on college enrollment r ates, we
may link student surv ey responses to NSC / other data we are appro ved to
analyz e in this study in order to contextualiz e those findings with students'
responses."

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Though research has shown field trips can impro ve students’ learning and
critical thinking skills, there has not been an experimental study on their
impact on science, technology , engineering, and medicine (STEM) career
choices, especially using a cultur ally responsiv e strategy . This r andomiz ed
controlled study will use an explanatory sequential mix ed methodological
design to assess if a museum-based field trip experience will increase
students’ interest in STEM career . Furthermore, in order to fully understand
the outcome, its influence will be ev aluated through an ethnic identit y lens.
 
Seventh through twelfth gr ade students will participate in Learning Labs
while on a sponsored school field trip to the Museum. They will be r andomly
placed into a MedLab Learning Lab session (interv ention) or another
Learning Lab (control). In the former , they will use high-tech, real medical
training equipment to teach the students about one of three chronic illnesses
that are highly prev alent in Chicago (diabetes, asthma, or heart disease).
They will use clinical labor atory equipment and a human patient simulator to
diagnose a fictional patient. The goal is for students to ha ve a heightened
awareness of different health professionals and diagnosis procedures after
this science field trip , as well as gain an understanding on how sociocultur al
factors influence health.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
1. Discern whether an experiential museum field trip using real world
medical tr aining devices will increase the a wareness, interest, or
capacities to participate in STEM careers for middle and high school
students
 
2. Identif y how these outcomes are affected b y ethnic identit y as seen
through inter actions between the students, teachers, and their families
Seventh through twelfth gr ade students who are r andomly assigned to a
MedLab session (interv ention) will ha ve an increased a wareness of STEM
career options and local communit y health issues compared to students
assigned to the museum Learning Lab session (control) and that this
awareness will be related to their r acial and ethnic identit y.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Museum-facilitated school field trips exist in a h ybrid space between formal
and informal education. Lik e much learning, the most successful field trips
inhabit a space somewhere between didactic and completely free-choice
experiences. Co x-Peterson (2003) found that strongly proscriptiv e field trips
show lowered learning gains while others found more structured experiences
sometimes outperformed those that were individualiz ed and spontaneous
(Bamberger & T al, 2007; Gutwill & Allen, 2012). Our studied experience uses
real medical devices in a facilitated field trip designed for collabor ative
scenarios of the t ype found in real clinical settings. The question of
authenticit y can be used to thread that difference between free and
structure experiences: if it happens in the real world it can happen in the
experience. 
 
There are few equit y-focused research studies about learning in science
museums (F einstein & Meshoulam, 2014; Da wson, 2014). T o support equit y,
science museums should in vite audiences to engage in a broader social
conversation about the nature and implications of science (P edretti & Nazir ,
2011). As F einstein and colleagues (2013) explain, “They [science
museums] can build a window in the w all between science and public or a
tunnel through it ” (p. 391). Most scholarly work has been about the direct
representations of different r acial and ethnic cultures in museums, but little
attention has been giv en to how those cultures impact and are impacted b y
museums (Stein, Gariba y & Wilson, 2008). 
 
We assembled an equit y research fr amework based on four principles
identified from recent liter ature around equit y, youth and inter active learning
spaces. The first principle (hereafter: Metacognition) regards supporting the
open and direct acknowledgement of the history of inequit y in learning and
making learning explicit to the participants (V ossoughi, Escude’ , Kong &
Hooper , 2013; V ossoughi, Hooper & Escude’ , 2016). The second principle
includes being a ware of the goals and challenges of facilitation before,
during and after ev ents along with a wareness of personal beliefs (hereafter:
Purposeful F acilitation) (Garcia, 2015; V ossoughi, et al. , 2013). The third is
bringing a broad sense of pla yfulness to the progr am by making fun and
explor ation visible and open to nontr aditional v alues, roles and uses of new
tools/procedures along with supporting collectiv e play (hereafter:
Playfulness) (Calabrese Barton, T an & Greenberg, 2016; V ossoughi, et al. ,
2013). The final principle represents the support of y outh-centered
identities, in this case ethnic identit y (see below), b y creating an
environment where y outh can bring a broad r ange of identities to the space
and tak e ownership of ph ysical spaces b y changing them and/or pushing
boundaries of what the space and progr am were designed for (hereafter:
Youth Centered) (Calabrese Barton & T an, 2015).  
Ethnic Identit y, and the related concept of self , has offered researchers and
educators a new lens for understanding the intersection of culture and long-
term STEM learning (Calabrese Barton, et al. , 2012; Carlone & Johnson,
2007). Informal learning en vironments such as museums offer rich
opportunities for y outh and adults to dev elop and reinforce STEM identities
(Calabrese Barton et al. , 2012; NRC, 2009). This is especially true for y outh
of populations that are underrepresented in STEM fields (hereafter: URM
youth), largely due to the absence of school-based power structures.
Howev er, the concepts of identit y and self are challenging to define and
study among educators and researchers (F alk, 2009). Thus, our definitions
of identit y will be informed b y the field of adolescent dev elopment, which
has a mature scholarship around identit y as a research fr amework.
Specifically , we adopt the perspectiv e from V arelas, Martin, and K ane (2012)
that identit y is a lens through which people position themselv es and others
while making sense of stories and actions in life. Learning occurs through a
process combining content acquisition with this identit y construction.
 
Ethnic identit y is the part of one’ s global identit y that is tied to ethnic group
membership (Brittian, 2012; Umaña- Taylor et al, 2014). Theories
emphasizing the importance of group identification, such as social identit y
theory (T ajfel & T urner, 1986), posit that individuals maintain a positiv e
identit y through their acceptance of group membership . Based in social
identit y theory , ethnic identit y refers to an individual’ s sense of belonging to
an ethnic group , which is defined b y one’ s cultur al heritage, and includes
attributes such as v alues, tr aditions, and language (Phinney & Ong, 2007).
Ethnic identit y has been shown to be link ed to career decision making of
URM y outh (Duff y & Klingaman, 2009). Ethnic identit y has also been found
to be related to self -efficacy , a major component of most occupational
development models, for both Latina/Latino (Gushue, 2006) and African
American (Gushue & Whitson, 2006) y outh.
 
About 400,000 students visit the Museum each y ear as part of a field trip . Of
them, about 23,000 students attend a short, structured learning experience
facilitated b y Museum educators. Based on our prior ev aluations and studies,
they identif y as a majorit y minorit y population W e recogniz e that r aces and
cultures ha ve their own experiences and v alues distinct from one another
(Williams & Deutsch, 2016). Therefore, it is dangerous and inaccur ate to
lump them into one category of analysis (e.g. “non white”). Hence, wh y we
adopt ethnic identit y as a k ey component of our theoretical fr amework,
using it as a lens to analyz e our data within groups.
 
Social Cognitiv e Career Theory as an Occupational Dev elopmental
Framework Social cognitiv e career theory (SCCT) pro vides a fr amework for
understanding the process of choosing an academic major and/or career(Lent, Brown, & Hack ett, 1994), and it identifies factors that ma y influence
an adolescent ’s decision to pursue a career in a STEM field. SCCT highlights
the mechanisms that shape career related interests and decisions, and it
acknowledges the influence of demogr aphic factors (e.g. , race/ethnicit y and
gender identities) that can cause v ariations in the career dev elopment
process for people from historically underrepresented backgrounds. Giv en
the attention to the role of r ace/ethnicit y and the emphasis on explanatory
mechanisms (i.e. , learning experiences) in the SCCT fr amework, SCCT
provides a particularly helpful model to consider when exploring the
activities that lead to the benefits of participation in STEM progr ams for
adolescents.","to Date

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Though research has shown field trips can impro ve students’ learning and
critical thinking skills, there has not been an experimental study on their
impact on science, technology , engineering, and medicine (STEM) career
choices, especially using a cultur ally responsiv e strategy . This r andomiz ed
controlled study will use an explanatory sequential mix ed methodological
design to assess if a museum-based field trip experience will increase
students’ interest in STEM career . Furthermore, in order to fully understand
the outcome, its influence will be ev aluated through an ethnic identit y lens.
 
Seventh through twelfth gr ade students will participate in Learning Labs
while on a sponsored school field trip to the Museum. They will be r andomly
placed into a MedLab Learning Lab session (interv ention) or another
Learning Lab (control). In the former , they will use high-tech, real medical
training equipment to teach the students about one of three chronic illnesses
that are highly prev alent in Chicago (diabetes, asthma, or heart disease).
They will use clinical labor atory equipment and a human patient simulator to
diagnose a fictional patient. The goal is for students to ha ve a heightened
awareness of different health professionals and diagnosis procedures after
this science field trip , as well as gain an understanding on how sociocultur al
factors influence health.  
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
1. Discern whether an experiential museum field trip using real world
medical tr aining devices will increase the a wareness, interest, or
capacities to participate in STEM careers for middle and high school
students
 
2. Identif y how these outcomes are affected b y ethnic identit y as seen
through inter actions between the students, teachers, and their families
Seventh through twelfth gr ade students who are r andomly assigned to a
MedLab session (interv ention) will ha ve an increased a wareness of STEM
career options and local communit y health issues compared to students
assigned to the museum Learning Lab session (control) and that this
awareness will be related to their r acial and ethnic identit y.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Museum-facilitated school field trips exist in a h ybrid space between formal
and informal education. Lik e much learning, the most successful field trips
inhabit a space somewhere between didactic and completely free-choice
experiences. Co x-Peterson (2003) found that strongly proscriptiv e field trips
show lowered learning gains while others found more structured experiences
sometimes outperformed those that were individualiz ed and spontaneous
(Bamberger & T al, 2007; Gutwill & Allen, 2012). Our studied experience uses
real medical devices in a facilitated field trip designed for collabor ative
scenarios of the t ype found in real clinical settings. The question of
authenticit y can be used to thread that difference between free and
structure experiences: if it happens in the real world it can happen in the
experience. 
 
There are few equit y-focused research studies about learning in science
museums (F einstein & Meshoulam, 2014; Da wson, 2014). T o support equit y,
science museums should in vite audiences to engage in a broader social

Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
The Learning Lab and MedLab sessions are offered at the Museum regardless
of the research. The research is to study the effect of the sessions. As such,
the in-person sessions were stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As
face-to-face sessions resume, they will be conducted in accordance with all
state, local, Chicago Public School and museum guidance for face-to-face
contact. In addition, the research activities in volve observ ation, surv eys, and
phone or video focus groups/interviews for all participants as detailed in this
application. An y changes to the procedures that need to be implemented
because of the pandemic or other circumstances will be submitted as
modifications before an y collection of an y information or data. This protocol
and the forms associated with it (consent/assent forms, instruments) refers
to an in-person study , not focusing on e-learning or online classes.
This is an explanatory sequential mix ed methods experimental study . The
first portion of the study is to collect and analyz e quantitativ e data from the
survey instrument constructed b y the MSI R esearch and Ev aluation
Department. T eachers who registered for a Learning Lab at the Museum will
be contacted b y the Call Center and explained the study briefly . Teachers
interested in participating in the study will be sent an informed consent form
that describes the study in detail for their students to participate in the
Learning Lab . These classes will receiv e complimentary bus tr ansportation to
and from the Museum, as well a Learning Lab . Classes will be r andomly be
assigned to either a MedLab (experimental group) or a Learning Lab (control
group). T eachers assigned to the experimental group can choose one of
three MedLab topics (asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), and teachers
assigned to the control group can choose one of nine Learning Lab sessions:
Colorful Chemistry , Crime Lab , Engineering Design, Evidence Lab ,
Explor ation Mars with NA SA, Mars 2040, Mo ving with Newton, Science
Design, or W eather Wise.
Students in participating classes will complete a pre, immediate post, and
delayed response surv ey that would collect the quantitativ e information of
the students for the study . Teachers will be sent a package containing
parental consent forms, student assent/consent forms, and the pretest
survey to be completed as determined b y school protocol (for example,
Chicago Public Schools students will complete the pretests at home since
they are unable to complete research during school hours, unlik e suburban
schools). Pretests will not affect students’ educational records and will not be
FERPA protected. The students are then to giv e a signed parental consent
form, minor assent (under 17 y ears old) or participant consent (18 y ears of
age or older) and pretest to their teacher . The teacher will bring all
documents on the da y of the field trip to submit to a member of the
Research and Ev aluation team unless it has been determined the group will
have an observ ation conducted. In the case of observ ation, teachers will be
asked to scan consent forms in adv ance to confirm students ha ve consent to
be observ ed. This will allow the research team time to create nametags with
a discreet indicator (multi-colored stick ers; red meaning “does not ha ve
consent ”) to indicate consent status for all students in the session.The MEDLAB Online progr am is currently unable to oper ate properly . This
portion of the study design has been eliminated. Instead, an inter action
analysis will be conducted to better understand the technological experience
at the human patient simulator , ultrasound, and/or X -ray stations. Up to ten
classes participating in the study will be audio and video recorded. During
the Teacher Orientation, the research team will mention there is an
opportunit y to conduct observ ation with audio and visual recording. If the
teacher is willing to participate and the date of their visit works for the
research team, teachers and their class will be pro vided with an alternate
version of the consent and assent form specific to the inter action analysis.
 These data are for inter action analysis methods to capture the participant
learning and inter action with one another and the MedLab en vironment.
These data will be anon ymized where possible, with the remo val of de-
identif ying features such as names and names of organizations. Video and
audio recording will be optional for participants. P articipants will opt -in
through a checkbo x on the consent forms. In vestigators will only video
record in the MedLab space when all participants in the group ha ve
consented to video recording.
Failure to bring the consent and assent forms on the da y of the visit will
result in the remo val of the class from the study . The class will arriv e for the
MedLab/Learning Lab as a t ypical field trip . After the students complete the
lab, they will complete the posttest surv ey, or they will complete it at home
and the teacher will mail the surv ey to the Museum with a prepaid package
(which will be pro vided at the time of their lab) if there is limited time to
complete the surv ey after the lab . Teachers will be giv en a surv ey to
complete to measure how engage their groups were after a Learning Lab or
MedLab session and receiv e their dela yed post -tests. During some MedLab
sessions, a researcher will follow an observ ation rubric rooted in the
Partnerships in Education and R esilience (PEAR) 12 Dimensions of Success
for qualit y STEM out -of-school time progr ams. After a MedLab session is
finished, educators who led the session will complete a Daily MedLab Survey.
This 5-minute-long surv ey will allow the researchers to know an y anomalous
events that ma y affect data collection and to judge the qualit y of the MedLab
session that ma y lead it to either being successful or unsuccessful. Three
weeks after the field trip , teachers will distribute the dela yed post -test and
will mail the surv eys to the Museum via a prepaid mail en velope.
For participation in the quantitativ e study , schools will be offered a free bus
ride to the museum ($200 v alue), the Learning Lab fee for the school will be
waived ($120-$140 v alue) and the teacher will be offered a free tablet
device at the end of the school y ear (iP ad Air or Android equiv alent - $250
value). T eachers working for Chicago Public Schools (CPS) will be offered an
alternativ e of a $50 check or gift card in lieu of the tablet. If they choose the
tablet, they will sign submit an e-mail to us attesting that they ha ve
appro val from the CPS district ethics board to receiv e the tablet. The o verall
project includes a qualitativ e component that will begin after surv eys begin
to be receiv ed.
Parents who complete the consent form for the quantitativ e study will be
asked at the end of the consent form if they would lik e to be contactedabout participating in qualitativ e interviews. If they are interested, then they
will be ask ed to pro vide their contact information. P articipants of the
qualitativ e component will also be sent an information sheet to encour age
study participants and their families to participate in interviews. If interested
and eligible, separ ate consent forms will be sent b y the qualitativ e team to
confirm participation in the interviews. In addition to the information sheet,
a virtual information session will be conducted with teachers and students to
further encour age participation in interviews and to review the objectiv es of
the interviews, how to use the QR codes attached to the information sheets,
and how to complete the form.
Participating in this qualitativ e study will in volve completing an interview and
brief demogr aphic questionnaire. P articipants ha ve the option to participate
in person or remotely (e.g. , over phone or z oom). The consent and assent
process will precede the questionnaire and interview . Further , parents will
have the option to complete the interview and questionnaire in English or
Spanish. Materials tr anslated in Spanish for parents will be submitted before
interviews in Spanish are scheduled.
For in person participants
Once participants complete the consent and assent process for the learning
lab, the research team will send interview information to eligible
participants. When participants sign up , they will receiv e consent and assent
forms to confirm whether the caregiv er and/or y outh would lik e to
participate in the interview . The interviews will be scheduled at a time and
location con venient for the family . Youth will only be in vited for an interview
if the caregiv er pro vides consent. Y outh and caregiv ers will be interviewed
individually in separ ate, priv ate rooms to uphold participant priv acy and
confidentialit y. Two members of the research team will alw ays be present
with y outh. The in-person interview protocol is identical to the remote
interview protocol. Before beginning the interview , participants will be
reminded that they are welcome to skip an y questions they would lik e and
may withdr aw from the interview at an y time without penalt y.  Participants
will also be reminded that their responses are confidential, ex cept for
disclosures of harm to self or others.  The interviewer will notif y the
participant when the DVR has been activ ated. The interview will tak e up to
one hour to complete. After completing the interview , the participant will be
asked to complete a brief demogr aphic questionnaire. The participant will
have the option to complete the questionnaire via a hard cop y or online on
Qualtrics. If the participant w ants to complete the questionnaire online, then
a unique link will be sent to the participant. The research team will follow
interview tr anscription and data stor age procedures in accordance with our
current data and safet y monitoring section of the protocol (e.g. , censoring
personal information in written tr anscripts, storing files on a secure cloud
server). Once participation is complete, participants will be offered a $75 gift
card according to the compensation schedule outlined in our current
protocol. The gift card will be emailed to the participant within 30 da ys. They
will also be offered a resource pack et (currently on file), which can be
printed or emailed to them b y a member of the research team.
For remote participantsOn the date and time scheduled, a member of the research team will call the
participant on the pre- arranged platform (e.g. , Zoom or Google Meet). W e
expect that man y youth will be familiar with Z oom or Google Meet due to
virtual schooling, especially older y outh. Howev er, it is possible some y outh
may need assistance. W e will follow sev eral protocols for y outh participants:
 Youth will be sent a unique link with the date and time of their interview .
This information will be sent to their caregiv er as well. If the interview is
conducted with a CPS student, then information will also be shared with the
teacher . At the time of their interview , youth will be able to click a link that
will tak e them directly to the Z oom or Google Meet room, where a member
of the research team is already present. The researcher will lock the Z oom
or Google Meet room in order to ensure that no one “enters” the room
during the y outh’s interview . For youth who need assistance from their
caregiv er in setting up the equipment, the caregiv er will be ask ed to set up
the computer or tablet for the y outh and click the link that w as emailed for
Zoom or Google Meet. After the y outh is set up , the researcher will ask the
caregiv er or teacher to pro vide a semi-priv ate space so that the y outh is
able to answer questions freely .
The researcher will remind the participant that they are free to use a
pseudon ym. The participant ma y ask an y questions about the interview
process before it begins. A udio will be recorded using encrypted digital v oice
recorders or directly on Z oom or Google Meet. The video will not be
recorded. The participant will be ask ed to complete a brief , electronic
demogr aphic questionnaire. A unique link to the online questionnaire on
Qualtrics will be sent to the participant. The interviewer will indicate to the
participant when the interviewer has activ ated the recording. Once the
participant completes the questionnaire and interview , then the meeting will
end.
Once participation is complete, participants will be offered an $75 Visa
electronic gift card according to the compensation schedule. They will also
be offered a resource pack et (currently on file), which can be printed or
emailed to them b y a member of the research team."

experience will coordinate a time that works with their schedule to discuss progr amming.
Due to teachers’ busy schedules, interviews will be offered on google meet or phone call, in
addition to in-person, and can be held when most con venient for teachers, including after or
before school.","Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the motivation,
design, and implications of the project.
1. The current study is sponsored b y the United States Department of Education,
Education Inno vation and R esearch (EIR) Progr am. The study is conducted b y Project
SYNCERE (PS), in partnership with The P olicy & R esearch Group (PRG). Elementary and
middle schools (those that serv e students in 6th, 7th, and/or 8  grades) within the
Chicago Public School District (CPS) serv e as study implementation sites.
2. The 5- year project in vestigates the efficacy of ENpowered, a progr am designed to
increase middle school students’ engagement and interest in science, technology ,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and educational outcomes. The goal of the
ENpowered progr am is to increase interest in STEM careers among minorit y and
socioeconomically disadv antaged students. PRG will utiliz e a quasi-experimental design
(QED) with propensit y-score weighting of students to assess the impact of one
semester of exposure to the interv ention.
3. PRG conducts all ev aluation activities, including instrument dev elopment, data
collection, analysis, and report prepar ation. PS staff o versee implementation of
ENpowered at all study sites, coordinate progr am scheduling, tr ain PS instructors, and
conduct ENpowered fidelit y monitoring. ENpowered instructors from the PS team
implement the interv ention and manage da y-to-da y ENpowered activities.
1. In addition to participant questionnaire data collection (detailed in this application),
PRG has entered into a data sharing agreement with CPS School Qualit y Measurement
and R esearch (SQMR) office to collect de-identified administr ative data to determine the
progr am’s impact on student math and science course gr ades and standardiz ed test
scores (that proposed in vestigation is not co vered in this application). PRG and CPS
SQMR entered into the agreement on Ma y 1st, 2021.th","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
1. Data gathered from participant questionnaires administered at the beginning of the
Spring semester (baseline) and at the end of the Spring semester (post -progr am), will
be used to assess a number of explor atory research questions:
2. As compared to middle school students who are similar but not exposed to the
progr am (comparison), what is the impact of participating in ENpowered (treatment) on
the following theoretical antecedents of academic achiev ement at the end of the
academic school y ear:
1. Engagement in STEM?
2. Interest in engineering as a career?
3. Self-concept in STEM?
4. Self-efficacy in STEM?
5. Awareness of engineering careers?
Most of the context -building information PRG has gathered thus far has come from short
responses and quantitativ e data from the ENpowered Progr am Ev aluation forms. Therefore,
our lev el of understanding of what exactly participants or school staff v alue about the
ENpowered Progr am is limited. W e propose to conduct focus groups with participants and
teachers in volved with the progr am to answer two additional research questions of interest:
1. How w as the ENpowered curriculum receiv ed by students?
2. Does the experience v ary for students in different gr ades?
3. What, if an ything, could Project SYNCERE change to impro ve the progr am?
4. Did students feel ready for the ENpowered Games ev ent after completing the
curriculum?
Does a progr am lik e the ENpowered Progr am increase student interest in further pursuing
STEM classes or careers, particularly engineering? Wh y or wh y not?","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is the
contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body of
extant knowledge?
1. According to the Bureau of Labor , most of the fastest growing occupations are based
in science and mathematics, and STEM-related jobs grew at a higher r ate than non-
STEM jobs between 2000 and 2010. Despite the demand for people to fill technical jobs,
the United States has struggled to attr act and retain students in STEM fields, especially
women and underrepresented minorit y groups. The National Action Council for
Minorities in Engineering reports that minorit y students are disproportionately
underrepresented in engineering, as they account for less than 12.5% of bachelor ’s
degrees in engineering but represent 30% of the nation’ s population.
2. There is much evidence to support that elementary and middle school students
receiv e inadequate exposure to STEM topics through tr aditional formal education. Only
10% of elementary students regularly engage in hands-on science, meaning man y
students reach middle school underprepared and unmotiv ated to pursue path ways that
could lead to a career in STEM (Carroll 2014; W einstein, Whitesell, and Leardo 2014).
Researchers ha ve found that success in STEM depends not only on academic
preparedness in school but also informal learning experiences, family and peer support,
and individual student char acteristics (Dorsen, Carlson, and Goody ear 2006; Olsz ewski-
Kubilius 2006). F or underrepresented minorities, research demonstr ates the importance
of STEM-specific career guidance, as these students struggle to en vision themselv es in
a career that is lik ely unfamiliar to them or their family members (Cohen and P atterson
2012; Dorsen, Carslon, and Goody ear 2006).
3. The ENpowered progr am addresses these issues b y exposing students to hands-on
learning in STEM. Through the progr am, students participate in design challenges that
are modeled after real- world problems that are solv ed through science and engineering.
Students are also introduced to scientists and engineers in their own communities
which helps students from underrepresented groups imagine themselv es in STEM
careers (Adams, Gupta, and DeF elice 2012; DeWitt and Archer 2015). The progr am
culminates with the “ENpowered Games” competition in which students compete across
schools to design a solution to a real- world engineering problem.
1. The purpose of this study is to determine what, if an y, impact the ENpowered
progr am has on students’ engagement in STEM, interest in engineering as a career ,
self-concept in STEM, self -efficacy in STEM, and a wareness of engineering careers. T o
that end, we plan to use a QED with propensit y score weighting to assess the impact of
the progr am. The study will compare outcomes for students who receiv e the ENpowered
progr am (treatment) with students who are similar to the ENpowered group in
observ able demogr aphic and baseline char acteristics, but who do not receiv e the
ENpowered progr am during the academic y ear in question (comparison). W e will use a
difference-in-difference (DID) approach to estimate the effect of the ENpowered
progr am on outcomes. The final empirical model used to calculate propensit y scores will
be refined b y examining diagnostics to maximiz e the baseline balance of the treatment
and comparison groups on observ able baseline co variates, including the baseline
measure of each outcome.","to Date

Focus Groups
Interviews
QuestionnairePlease outline your protocol for focus group activities, describing when, where,
duration, frequency, and with whom. 
i. PRG will work with participating schools to plan how and when the focus groups will tak e
place during the school da y. Each school has a designated staff member to work with PRG to
plan the focus groups with students. Ideally , focus groups will tak e place during study hall or
lunch periods so as not to interfere with students’ core classes, but PRG will defer to the
school’ s contact as to the best time to conduct the focus groups. A t the time of the focus
group at each school, a designated CPS staff member will sit in the same room and help with
classroom management only as needed. P er CPS rules for background checks, the PRG staff
members who will be leading the focus groups will plan to gain Lev el 1 clear ance. PRG staff
members will nev er be alone with the students.
ii. Each focus group will tak e about 30-40 minutes, and only students who return a consent
and assent form will be allowed to participate. Students who participate ma y leave at an y
time or abstain from answering an y questions they do not wish to respond to . The siz e of the
focus groups at each school will depend on the number of students in progr amming and how
many students and parents consent to participate, but groups will ideally consist of 6-8
students per group .
iii. PRG will work with the school contact to schedule the focus group administr ation dates,
but our intention is to talk with students after the ENpowered Progr am concludes on April
26, 2024.
Does this involve video, audio, or photograph recording?
Yes
Please describe the protocol for audio/video recording
i. At the beginning of the focus group , the PRG staff member working as the focus group
facilitator will inform the students before beginning audio recording, and let an y students
leave if they do not wish to be recorded. Notice of audio recording will also be included on the
consent form, to mak e sure students and parents are a ware of the audio recording prior to
the da y of the focus group .
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
i. Focus groups will be held in person at the school sites, and PRG will record the audio of
focus groups on a handheld recording device with no access to the internet. After the focus
group concludes, PRG staff will upload the recording directly to the compan y’s secure serv er
and delete the ph ysical recording on the handheld recording device.
Please attach all study materials corresponding to focus group procedures (i.e.,
consent forms, protocol, recruitment and incentive plans)

Progr am at each of the schools. Only teachers who wish to speak to PRG about their
experience will coordinate a time that works with their schedule to discuss progr amming.
Due to teachers’ busy schedules, interviews will be offered on google meet or phone call, in
addition to in-person, and can be held when most con venient for teachers, including after or
before school.
Does this involve video, audio, or photograph recording?
Yes
Please describe the protocol for audio/video recording
At the beginning of the interviews with teachers, teachers will be ask ed if the con versation
can be recorded. F or teachers who do not wish to be recorded, notes will be tak en in lieu of
recording to ensure we capture the teacher ’s responses. R ecordings and notes will be k ept
anonymous to protect participants’ identities.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
Depending on the setting, interviews with teachers will be recorded on a handheld recording
device, via google meets recording softw are, or via a conference call line recording softw are.
Once the interview is completed, PRG staff will upload the focus group recording directly to
the compan y’s secure serv er and delete the ph ysical recording on the recording device or
computer . If a teacher elected to ha ve notes tak en instead, a PRG staff member will record
notes in a W ord document on their computer and ex clusiv ely sa ve the notes document to the
PRG secure serv er.

ii. PRG dev eloped the online questionnaire and is responsible for working with participating
schools to plan how and when it will be accessed b y students. Access to the online
questionnaire will depend on the school’ s schedule and learning model and additional
logistical details, lik e the t ype of devices the students ha ve.
iii. Each school will designate one staff member to work with PRG to arr ange administering
the online questionnaire to study students. The study questionnaire will be completed
through the Google F orms online surv ey platform. Students will access the questionnaire
using their school- assigned device (i.e. , Chromebook or iP ad) and the information pro vided
on their individual index cards pro vided b y PRG (surv ey link/QR code and student study ID
number). Students are instructed to t ype a short web address into a URL bar or use the
camer a on their device to scan the QR code.
iv. The administr ation of the questionnaires will tak e place at schools during designated class
times o ver the school da y. It is expected that the surv ey administr ation will tak e about 30-
45 minutes, including assembling the students, reading out the questionnaire instructions,
and the actual time it tak es for the participants to complete the questionnaire (about 10-15
minutes).
v. PRG will work with the school contact to schedule a questionnaire administr ation date and
make-up dates for the:
1. Baseline questionnaire: completed at the beginning of the spring semester , before the first
ENpowered classroom lesson at the school
2. Post-Progr am Questionnaire: completed at the end of the school y ear, after the
ENpowered Games ev ent
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the motivation,
design, and implications of the project.
1. The current study is sponsored b y the United States Department of Education,
Education Inno vation and R esearch (EIR) Progr am. The study is conducted b y Project
SYNCERE (PS), in partnership with The P olicy & R esearch Group (PRG). Elementary and
middle schools (those that serv e students in 6th, 7th, and/or 8  grades) within the
Chicago Public School District (CPS) serv e as study implementation sites.
2. The 5- year project in vestigates the efficacy of ENpowered, a progr am designed to
increase middle school students’ engagement and interest in science, technology ,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and educational outcomes. The goal of the
ENpowered progr am is to increase interest in STEM careers among minorit y and
socioeconomically disadv antaged students. PRG will utiliz e a quasi-experimental design
(QED) with propensit y-score weighting of students to assess the impact of one
semester of exposure to the interv ention.
3. PRG conducts all ev aluation activities, including instrument dev elopment, data
collection, analysis, and report prepar ation. PS staff o versee implementation of
ENpowered at all study sites, coordinate progr am scheduling, tr ain PS instructors, and
conduct ENpowered fidelit y monitoring. ENpowered instructors from the PS team
implement the interv ention and manage da y-to-da y ENpowered activities.
1. In addition to participant questionnaire data collection (detailed in this application),
PRG has entered into a data sharing agreement with CPS School Qualit y Measurement
and R esearch (SQMR) office to collect de-identified administr ative data to determine the
progr am’s impact on student math and science course gr ades and standardiz ed test
scores (that proposed in vestigation is not co vered in this application). PRG and CPS
SQMR entered into the agreement on Ma y 1st, 2021.thResearch Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
1. Data gathered from participant questionnaires administered at the beginning of the
Spring semester (baseline) and at the end of the Spring semester (post -progr am), will
be used to assess a number of explor atory research questions:
2. As compared to middle school students who are similar but not exposed to the
progr am (comparison), what is the impact of participating in ENpowered (treatment) on
the following theoretical antecedents of academic achiev ement at the end of the
academic school y ear:
1. Engagement in STEM?
2. Interest in engineering as a career?
3. Self-concept in STEM?
4. Self-efficacy in STEM?
5. Awareness of engineering careers?
Most of the context -building information PRG has gathered thus far has come from short
responses and quantitativ e data from the ENpowered Progr am Ev aluation forms. Therefore,
our lev el of understanding of what exactly participants or school staff v alue about the
ENpowered Progr am is limited. W e propose to conduct focus groups with participants and
teachers in volved with the progr am to answer two additional research questions of interest:
1. How w as the ENpowered curriculum receiv ed by students?
2. Does the experience v ary for students in different gr ades?
3. What, if an ything, could Project SYNCERE change to impro ve the progr am?
4. Did students feel ready for the ENpowered Games ev ent after completing the
curriculum?
Does a progr am lik e the ENpowered Progr am increase student interest in further pursuing
STEM classes or careers, particularly engineering? Wh y or wh y not?Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is the
contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body of
extant knowledge?
1. According to the Bureau of Labor , most of the fastest growing occupations are based
in science and mathematics, and STEM-related jobs grew at a higher r ate than non-
STEM jobs between 2000 and 2010. Despite the demand for people to fill technical jobs,
the United States has struggled to attr act and retain students in STEM fields, especially
women and underrepresented minorit y groups. The National Action Council for
Minorities in Engineering reports that minorit y students are disproportionately
underrepresented in engineering, as they account for less than 12.5% of bachelor ’s
degrees in engineering but represent 30% of the nation’ s population.
2. There is much evidence to support that elementary and middle school students
receiv e inadequate exposure to STEM topics through tr aditional formal education. Only
10% of elementary students regularly engage in hands-on science, meaning man y
students reach middle school underprepared and unmotiv ated to pursue path ways that
could lead to a career in STEM (Carroll 2014; W einstein, Whitesell, and Leardo 2014).
Researchers ha ve found that success in STEM depends not only on academic
preparedness in school but also informal learning experiences, family and peer support,
and individual student char acteristics (Dorsen, Carlson, and Goody ear 2006; Olsz ewski-
Kubilius 2006). F or underrepresented minorities, research demonstr ates the importance
of STEM-specific career guidance, as these students struggle to en vision themselv es in
a career that is lik ely unfamiliar to them or their family members (Cohen and P atterson
2012; Dorsen, Carslon, and Goody ear 2006).
3. The ENpowered progr am addresses these issues b y exposing students to hands-on
learning in STEM. Through the progr am, students participate in design challenges that
are modeled after real- world problems that are solv ed through science and engineering.
Students are also introduced to scientists and engineers in their own communities
which helps students from underrepresented groups imagine themselv es in STEM
careers (Adams, Gupta, and DeF elice 2012; DeWitt and Archer 2015). The progr am
culminates with the “ENpowered Games” competition in which students compete across
schools to design a solution to a real- world engineering problem.
1. The purpose of this study is to determine what, if an y, impact the ENpowered
progr am has on students’ engagement in STEM, interest in engineering as a career ,
self-concept in STEM, self -efficacy in STEM, and a wareness of engineering careers. T o
that end, we plan to use a QED with propensit y score weighting to assess the impact of
the progr am. The study will compare outcomes for students who receiv e the ENpowered
progr am (treatment) with students who are similar to the ENpowered group in
observ able demogr aphic and baseline char acteristics, but who do not receiv e the
ENpowered progr am during the academic y ear in question (comparison). W e will use a
difference-in-difference (DID) approach to estimate the effect of the ENpowered
progr am on outcomes. The final empirical model used to calculate propensit y scores will
be refined b y examining diagnostics to maximiz e the baseline balance of the treatment
and comparison groups on observ able baseline co variates, including the baseline
measure of each outcome.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated with
this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will be asked
of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
1. Prior to the ENpowered progr amming starting, all consenting students will be ask ed
to fill out an electronic questionnaire that asks them questions on their attitudes and
beliefs related to STEM. The questionnaire is included in this submission and tak es, on
average, 15-20 minutes to complete. A t the end of the spring semester , after
progr amming ends for treatment students, students in both treatment and comparison
groups will be ask ed to fill out the same electronic questionnaire.
1. At the end of the 2024 ENpowered Progr am, all consenting students will be ask ed to
participate in a 30–40-minute focus group that will be discussion based. The focus
group will tak e place during school, will be monitored b y a CPS staff member present in
the same room, and will be held in English. Students can choose to answer or not to
answer an y question ask ed by the facilitators.
2. At the end of the 2024 ENpowered Progr am, all consenting teachers will be ask ed to
participate in a 20-minute interview st yle discussion held in English. The interview will
take place when the teacher finds it most con venient, and the teacher will be able to
skip an y questions they are not comfortable answering and can end the interview at
any time","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical techniques
that will be utilized as part of this study.
1. PRG will conduct a quasi-experimental design (QED) that emplo ys both propensit y-
score weighting and difference-in-differences (DID) analysis to assess the impact of one
semester of exposure to ENpowered on student engagement in STEM, interest in
engineering as a career , self-concept in STEM, self -efficacy in STEM, and a wareness of
engineering careers. T reatment participants will be a weighted sample of students who
receiv e the ENpowered progr am at study implementation schools; comparison
participants will be a weighted sample of students at study implementation schools who
do not receiv e ENpowered. W e will estimate the treatment effect b y way of a difference-
in-difference (DID) method that is common in progr am ev aluation and education
research. F or every student in the study , we will use a pre- and post -interv ention
measurement of the outcome to assess the impact of the interv ention as the a verage
“difference in differences” between the treatment and comparison groups. W e expect to
estimate the DID impact with a multi-lev el model that includes r andom and fix ed effects
for school membership . The study will compare outcomes for a weighted sample of
students who receiv e the ENpowered progr am with a weighted sample of students who
do not receiv e the ENpowered progr am during the academic y ear in question and ha ve
not receiv ed the progr am during a previous y ear."

As part of the Scr atch Encore curriculum, students are giv en time in class to design and
implement Scr atch computer progr ams. Students are encour aged to be creativ e during
this time and come up with projects based on topics they are interested in. During this
independent work time during class, researchers in the classroom will conduct brief ,
informal interviews with students to learn about the projects students are creating, the
challenges they are facing, and their o verall thoughts about the assignment and course
overall. These brief , informal interviews will tak e place during class time but not interfere
with instruction and be recorded using hand-held camer as. Only fully consented students
will be interviewed. The video will record the students' screens while they explain their
projects. No student faces will be captured. W e plan to collect this data during the
Harmoniz ed modules, which will mean two or three class periods (when students are
doing independent work) during the entiret y of the Scr atch Encore curriculum.","Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the motivation,
design, and implications of the project.
This multi- year project seeks to pro vide actionable and empirically grounded insight into
the following questions: “ How can we support and empower teachers to customize
instructional computing materials that meet both academic standards and the needs of
diverse student populations? What are the classroom outcomes of using such materials? ”
This proposal is designed to respond to a number of realities about the current state of
computer science (CS) instruction in K -12.
1. Computer science is an essential topic for all students across K-12 education .
2. Instructional materials that advance equity must support diverse teacher and
student populations.
3. The only constant is change .
4. Creating effective, custom, culturally responsive materials is challenging.
5. Empowering teacher customization .
Towards responding to these challenges, we ha ve created a curriculum in collabor ation
with CPS called Scr atch Encore that teaches computer science in a cultur ally responsiv e
way. Building on this curriculum, we ha ve designed a teacher PD that prepares teachers
to create unique, localiz ed instructional materials that fit within the Scr atch Encore
curriculum and align with the v oices, v alues, and priorities of their students and local
communit y. We call this process ""harmonizing"".
The proposed study seeks to understand the impact of teaching Harmoniz ed Scr atch
Encore lessons. This includes understanding the experience of teachers who are doing the
Harmonizing and students who are learning with materials uniquely designed from them
and their class.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Teacher Supports: What knowledge, supports, and scaffolds are needed to empower
teachers to customiz e instructional materials to be cultur ally responsiv e to the unique

the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body
of extant knowledge?
This work dr aws on three complementary liter atures:
1. Computer science in Upper Elementary Grades
Early work on progr amming as a means for learning conducted b y Papert and colleagues
with the Logo language found that progr amming w as accessible to y ounger learners and
could serv e as a powerful pedagogical str ategy (Harel & P apert, 1991; P apert, 1980;
Papert et al. , 1979). As such, instruction for y ounger students on computing is often
based on a Constructionist design and learning approach (P apert, 1980). This approach
emphasiz es student -driven learning, constructing artifacts, and creating a low -threshold,
high-ceiling, wide- walls learning en vironment (R esnick et al. , 2009). Constructionism’ s
focus on student -driven learning, r ather than mastery of specific technical content, has
resulted in the adoption in informal spaces (Maloney et al. , 2008) that place an emphasis
on self -directed learning and online collabor ation (Fields et al. , 2014; R oque et al. , 2012)
and the pr actices of computing (Brennan, 2013). As the Scr atch and Scr atch-inspired
learning en vironments mo ve into formal classrooms, man y schools ha ve shifted the focus
to specific content learning goals where such open-ended curricula are not as well-suited
given the differing goals (Salac et al. , 2019).
While tr aditionally a subject for high school and bey ond, there is growing demand for
bringing CS into K -8 classrooms. In response to this push, there is a growing libr ary of
introductory curricula designed for elementary learners, lik e code.org’ s CS Disco veries
curriculum, the F oundations for Adv ancing Computational Thinking (F ACT) curriculum
(Grover et al. , 2015), and the KELP-CS curriculum (Hill et al. , 2015). Y et, there is no
widely used curriculum the mo ves bey ond introductory activities to pro vide deeper
investigations of CS concepts and pr actices for elementary learners. Instead, teachers
search online for resources from v enues lik e the CS for All curriculum directory and then
adapt them to their needs, schools purchase closed packages, or teachers create their
own. All three of these str ategies are ill-suited for teachers with little experience in
computing or teaching in under -resourced schools.
The last decade has seen significant adv ances in our understanding of how to introduce
younger learners to the powerful ideas of computing. One example of this can be seen in
the dev elopment of learning tr ajectories of computer science concepts for y ounger
learners (Rich et al. , 2017, 2018, 2019). P edagogy has also been an activ e area of
research in this space. F or example, the Use-Modif y-Create instructional sequencing
(Franklin, et al. , 2020a; I. Lee et al. , 2011) pro vides scaffolds in the form of pro viding
example code and smaller tasks (via the Use and Modif y activities) to build conceptual
understanding and skills before loosening constr aints to allow for learner -direct, open-
ended projects (via the Create activit y), which align more closely with Constructionist
goals (Harel & P apert, 1991). A second example is TIPP&SEE (Salac et al. , 2020), a
learning str ategy that effectiv ely scaffolds students in how to learn from example code in
Scratch projects. T o do so , learners first record observ ations of the example code, then
inspect the code and mak e changes to see what happens. This approach showed
significant positiv e performance outcomes for y oung learners (Salac et al. , 2020). Finally ,
an area of significant growth in the K -12 computing education space is in the
development of cultur ally relev ant computing curricula, which we discuss in greater detail
in the following section.
2. Culturally Responsive Computer Science Education
The conceptualization of cultur ally responsiv e computing instruction we emplo y in this
research builds on the work of Scott and colleagues (2015), itself grounded in cultur ally
responsiv e pedagogy (Ga y, 2010; Ladson-Billings, 2014). Cultur ally responsiv e
computing diminishes the separ ation between CS and students’ other cultur al worlds
while empowering learners to dr aw on both v ernacular and heritage culture resources tocreate and learn in computing contexts (Eglash et al. , 2013).
Cultur ally responsiv e computing instruction can be accomplished in sev eral ways (Scott et
al., 2015). F or example, when explaining concepts, examples can be dr awn from
students’ current knowledge and existing prior experiences, what P apert called ”cultur al
syntonicit y” (Papert, 1980). A second str ategy dr aws upon the cultur al heritage of
students as a means to help increase their sense of belonging. This can tak e the form of
including visual elements dr awn from their culture or situating progr amming activities
within cultur ally significant contexts (Ga y, 2010; Ladson-Billings, 2009). Y et another
approach to dev eloping a cultur ally responsiv e curriculum dr aws upon current y outh
culture, such as social pr actices (e.g. texting), media, or video games (e.g. F ortnite).
Code.org uses this approach b y partnering with Disney , Minecr aft, and famous athletes
and celebrities. Finally , creativ e opportunities that empower learners to tailor projects to
their own interests allow them to choose how to connect it to their personal culture (R yoo
et al., 2013). Examples of this t ype of work can be found in formal computing curricula
such as Exploring Computer Science, which allows students to embed their own culture
and w ays of knowing into the work that they do and pro vides teachers with professional
development to include communit y relev ant and critical examples within the computing
classroom encour aging cultur ally responsiv e computing opportunities for students (Goode
& Margolis, 2011; R yoo et al. , 2013). The integr ation of cultur al resources, equit y, and
social justice can also be found in educational opportunities bey ond the classroom. This
work dr aws directly from foundational research on the structur al inequalities and differing
opportunities that exist in computer science (Margolis, 2008; Margolis & Fisher , 2003).
In the informal space, man y computing summer camp progr ams ha ve been designed to
attend to issues of equit y, opportunit y and dr aw on learners’ prior resources. F or
example, Lee’ s work promoting critical computational liter acy (Lee & Garcia, 2014)
through Y outh R adio empowers teens to critique and present current and relev ant
injustices within their liv es through digital and computational means and share them with
broad audiences (Lee & Soep , 2016, 2018). Other summer camps focus on specific
technologies, lik e e-textiles (Holbert, 2016; K afai et al. , 2019), or are designed to dr aw
on specific heritage cultures lik e Mayan culture (Fr anklin et al. , 2011) or Indigenous
weaving pr actices (Searle & K afai, 2015).
Tool design is another a venue pursued to attend to issues of equit y and social justice in
computing. This can be seen in work around Cultur ally Situated Design T ools, which
integr ate computing, design, and mathematical concepts based on authentic connection
to those concepts in non-dominant cultures (Eglash et al. , 2006) and built through deep
collabor ation with the communities being represented (Lachney , 2017). The
computational action fr amework (Tissenbaum et al. , 2019) views computing as a means
to amplif y student v oice through the creation of mobile apps using AppIn ventor.
3 Computer science Teacher Professional Development
A significant body of research exists on the design of effectiv e and sustainable teacher PD
(for a review of this liter ature, see Bork o, 2004; Darling-Hammond et al. , 2017).
According to Desimone and colleagues (2011; 2015), effectiv e PD includes the following
factors: (a) Content focus  - Emphasizing content and how students learn content; (b)
Active learning  - Pro viding opportunities for teachers to be in volved in activities during PD
rather than listening passiv ely; (c) Coherence  - Aligning PD content to other PD
opportunities, teachers' knowledge and beliefs, and school, district, and state policies;
(d) Duration  - PD should include 20 hours or more of contact and last o ver at least a
semester of time; and (e) Collective participation  - Teachers should work together in a
learning communit y with other teachers from the same gr ade, subject, or school
(Desimone, 2011; Desimone & Garet, 2015). This fr amework has been shown to be
successful across multiple subjects and age groups (Gersten et al. , 2010; P enuel et al. ,
2011). Through a systematic liter ature review , Menekse concluded that effectiv e PD for
CS educators also requires similar factors: dur ation, activ e learning, pedagogical content
knowledge focus, collabor ation with local district or school administr ation, and support for
classroom implementation (Menekse, 2015). Menekse (2015) did not include an y factors
that map to Desimone's collective participation . Additionally , support for classroomimplementation , which is not a factor in Desimone's fr amework, is important for ha ving
teachers try new teaching pr actices (Menekse, 2015).
The last decade has seen a growth in research on CS teacher prepar ation, although the
consensus from the field is that significant open questions remain (Basu et al. , 2021;
Menekse, 2015; Mouza et al. , 2021). The recent scholarship on CS teacher prepar ation
has largely focused on three topics: (1) qualitativ e work on the experiences of those
learning to become CS teachers (Mouza et al. , 2018; R eding & Dorn, 2017), (2) the
development and refinement of CS pedagogical content knowledge (Hubbard, 2018;
Yadav & Berges, 2019), and (3) efforts focused on equit y, diversity, and social justice
(Goode et al. , 2021; R yoo, 2019), which are the most closely aligned with this project.
Research on cultur ally responsiv e CS PD has identified a number of str ategies for
supporting teachers, including dev eloping professional learning communities to support
dialog (R yoo et al. , 2016), online learning professional dev elopment (Goode et al. , 2020),
and through efforts to help teachers dr aw on the existing knowledge and cultur al
resources of students through cultur ally responsiv e pedagogy (Madkins et al. , 2019).","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated with
this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will be
asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
The study being proposed here is the third y ear of a 4 y ear project. Y ear 3 of the project
will serv e as the primary classroom study for the Harmonizing Scr atch Encore project.
Year 3 will begin b y running the HSE PD for a cohort of CPS T eachers. W e have run this
PD in the past for both CPS and national teachers. The primary research activit y in y ear
three is to collect data related to what happens when y ou bring Harmoniz ed Scr atch
Encore materials into the classroom. T o do so , we will conduct classroom observ ations
and focus groups with CPS teachers. Along with collecting teacher data, we will collect
data from students in CPS classrooms, including student -completed course materials,
surveys, and brief in-class interviews (but not collect an y PII). A t the end of y ear 3, we
will also collect the instructional materials designed b y the teachers as well as the
student -authored projects that resulted from teaching those lessons. P articipating CPS
teachers will complete the summer Harmonizing Scr atch Encore PD , the teachers will
Harmoniz e a Scr atch Encore lesson, and then teach Scr atch Encore, including the
Harmoniz ed lesson, in their classes. T eachers will share the materials the create and the
materials students produce (from consented students only) with researchers as well as
participate in short focal group interviews. T eachers will be compensated $500 for
participating in this study due to the out -of-class work we are requiring (including
creating the Harmoniz ed instructional materials during the summer and participating in
interviews during the school y ear).","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
In this section, we detail our methodological and analytic approaches. This project will
emplo y a mix ed-methods study design to collect quantitativ e, qualitativ e, and
computational data. This includes quantitativ e data in the form of surv eys, qualitativ e
data through observ ations, semi-structured interviews, and student -created artifacts, and
computational data through student -authored progr ams. Our analytic approach for this
project uses a multi-method triangulation approach to create v alid analytic methods to
measure teacher and student -level outcomes (Meijer et al. , 2002). Below we organiz e our
research methodology/analytic technique b y research question.
Answering our Teacher Impact Research Question
Having designed and run the HSE PD , our T eacher Impact research question asks: How
do teaching practices shift when teachers are teaching culturally responsive curricular
materials they have created? This question shifts focus tow ards how these unique-to-
their-classroom materials impact the teacher , considering both how their instructional
practices shift when teaching these materials as well as the w ays the teachers
incorpor ate the prior knowledge and cultur al resources dr awn upon in the materials into
the enactment of the lesson.
Data Sources . To understand the v arious w ays that teaching pr actices change when
teachers are using the materials they dev eloped during the HSE PD , we will triangulate
data from a number of sources. W e will conduct classroom observations  for both
traditional Encore and customiz ed HSE lessons, focusing on differences between
instruction. Observ ers will tak e detailed field notes on implementation fidelit y as well as
complete an observ ation rubric (dev eloped during the prior research study) after each
observ ation session. W e will also conduct focus group sessions  to serv e as a context to
identif y shared experiences across the participants and pro vide an opportunit y for group
reflection on the experience of designing and teaching HSE-created modules.
Analytic Approach . Our analytic approach for answering the T eacher Impacts research
question will dr aw on sev eral qualitativ e methodologies. Classroom observ ations and field
notes will be open-coded to identif y emergent patterns and trends in the data.
Compar ative coding str ategies (Saldaña, 2015) will be used to identif y differences
between existing Encore modules and teacher -created HSE modules. The results of this
analysis will be used to inform the questions ask ed in the focus group sessions as well as
the coding approach for resulting tr anscripts. T ranscripts will be thematically analyz ed to
identif y patterns in responses for questions related to their experiences teaching both
Encore Modules and HSE modules.
Answering our Student Impact Research Question
Our Student Impact research questions ask: How do students respond to culturally
responsive curricular modules created by their teachers? How do these lessons impact
students from historically excluded populations in computing? These questions shift focus
from teachers to students to better understand how cultur ally responsiv e materials
designed for their specific classroom impacts the experience of students. In asking this
question, we consider both conceptual learning outcomes as well as affectiv e outcomes,
including self -efficacy , confidence, and sense of belonging.
Data Sources . To evaluate the impact on students, we will rely on surv eys and analysis
of student -created artifacts. Surveys , taken at the beginning and end of each school
year, will serv e as an initial measure of student interest, confidence, and sense of
belonging in CS and be one measure for if and how those dimensions change o ver the
school y ear. Student-created artifacts , including worksheets and student -authored
Scratch projects, will be collected for future analysis. Brief in-class interviews  about
studnet -author Scr atch projects will be collected for future analysis.Analytic Approach . We will use standard statistical methods to analyz e the pre and
post-surveys and scores on content assessments within the curriculum. P airwise t -tests
will measure changes in student performance on the course assessments in aggregate.
We will conduct a Wilco xon Signed R ank test on the attitudinal surv ey’s Likert-scale
questions, giv en the ordinal nature of the Lik ert responses and because it is a
nonpar ametric test used to compare paired samples. The student -produced artifacts and
interviews will be qualitativ ely coded for CS content present as well as topics and themes
incorpor ated into the project. T o conduct this analysis, we will use the Spheres of
Influence fr amework (Coenr aad et al. , In Press) dev eloped through participatory design
sessions with learners in our target population during the Scr atch Encore Project. This
framework identifies sources of inspir ation from learners’ liv es that can be dr awn upon
when creating personaliz ed progr amming projects. Importantly , all of the analyses will
look at the student population as a whole as well as specific analyses on students who
have self -identified as being a member of a population historically ex cluded in computing."

Students: Consented and assenting students receiving Lumit y progr amming
and business as usual classroom activities completed a one-time pretest
questionnaire in Y ear 1 of the study and mid-point questionnaires at the end
of the school y ear in 2021 and 2022. W e observ ed students in remote
progr am learning activities via participation using Z oom (e.g. , ""site visits""
with businesses using STEM in work processes, STEM talks), focused upon
Lumit y staff progr am implementation and broad student engagement.
Teachers: Fiv e teachers whose classrooms host Lumit y progr am activities
interviewed were interviewed in 2021 and 2022 about progr am
implementation, factors that affect implementation, student engagement,
and perception of impacts upon students.
School leaders: One or two leaders from each participating school were
interviewed in each of the participating schools in 2021 and 2022.
Secondary data analysis: W e requested administr ative data for consented
students.Preliminary Results to Date
Students: Administr ative data is not y et available to assess differences in
school achiev ement between Lumit y and non-Lumit y students.
Questionnaire data from 2021 indicated higher lev els of knowledge about
STEM careers among Lumit y students. Data from 2022 is still being
analyz ed.
Teachers and school leaders: T wenty-one interviews were conducted during
the first two y ears of the study .
Teachers believ ed participating in Lumit y Progr amming helped to expose
their students to STEM professionals, a v ariety of potential STEM careers,
and, at least for some students, problem-solving activities they otherwise
would not ha ve encountered through regular classroom instruction. T eachers
also indicated that Lumit y staff were able to successfully engage their
students. Sev eral teachers identified how Lumit y lessons aligned with their
curriculum, and the v alue of lessons focused on social emotional learning
skill dev elopment, in particular , given the emotional and social challenges
created b y COVID disruptions. Finally , teachers mentioned that their
students enjo yed the inter active aspects of Lumit y’s progr amming most,
particularly the real- world projects and career site visits, where the students
were able to apply what they learned in pr actice.
Teachers and school leaders also identified implementation challenges for
the Lumit y progr am, including coordination of lessons with CPS school
calendars and school leadership (e.g. , field trips), occasions when a lesson
plan w as not fully completed during a single session, opportunities for better
information sharing from Lumit y, and opportunities for closer alignment
between Lumit y and existing classroom curriculum.

The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of using specific, short example
videos and gr aphic organiz ers on facilitating effectiv e collabor ative co-teaching
relationships between a special education teacher and a gener al education teacher .
The reflectiv e journals of the teachers will be used to look for evidence that
demonstr ates effectiv e co-teaching pr actices as well as evidence that the special
education teachers' feel v alued and satisfied with their role.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Research Question(s): Do the tools (videos and gr aphic organiz ers) pro vided b y
the researcher impact the implementation of high-lev erage pr actices in a co-
taught classroom? What impact does the implementation of these activities ha ve
on the feelings of v alue reported b y the special education teacher?
Hypothesis: My h ypothesis is that the use of the tools pro vided will cause co-
teaching partners to report feeling their communication is more effectiv e and
efficient, and that the special education teachers will report feeling more v alued
and supported in their role, as well as more equit y and parit y in their role in the
classroom.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject.
What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build
upon the body of extant knowledge?
The data around the numbers of teachers in the field can be misleading since the
number of teachers in the field is growing. Howev er, the reason for the national
concern regarding attrition is that our country is not k eeping up with the demand
for more teachers as class siz es shrink and specializ ed support increases (Ingersoll
et al., 2021). Inclusiv e practices ha ve contributed to the demand for more special
education and English Language Learner teachers. In addition, as attrition
spreads, it ma y not alw ays look lik e empt y positions in a school. Though man y
schools suffer from empt y positions, some, ma y just ha ve higher turno ver,
particularly for certain positions (Adamson & Darling-Hammond, 2011; Cardichon
et al., 2020; Carv er-Thomas & Darling-Hammond, 2017; P odolsky et. al, 2016;
U.S. Department of Education, 2023).
About half of teachers lea ve in their first fiv e years on the job (Ha ynes, 2014).
This is more than t ypical attrition in other fields. One reason man y teachers lea ve
is they feel unprepared for the classroom. A research brief prepared b y Podolsky
et al. (2016) highlights the importance of properly tr aining teachers. T eachers who
are unprepared for the field lea ve at a r ate 2-3 times those who are adequately
prepared (Ingersoll et al. , 2014).
Many studies on teacher attrition ha ve reported teachers listing dissatisfaction as
one of the main reasons they lea ve (Skaalvik et al. , 2011, Sutcher , 2016). It has
also been found that teachers who report higher job satisfaction are less lik ely to
leave, so much so that one standard deviation in satisfaction can cut y our chances
of lea ving b y around half (Sims & Jerrim, 2020). This emphasiz es the importance
of addressing feelings of dissatisfaction in teachers. Howev er, dissatisfaction is a
vague term, and less actionable to address at the school lev el without further
explor ation. A surv ey by the National Center for Education Statistics found that
two-thirds of teachers cited dissatisfaction for lea ving, identif ying concerns such as
“school administr ation (33%), lack of influence on school decision making (29%),
and school conditions, including facilities and resources (27%)” (Carv er-Thomas &
Darling-Hammond, 2017, p . 6). This helps narrow the con versation for purposes of
policy , though, if a school would lik e to address attrition steps will need to be
taken to understand specific experiences related to these concerns to be able to
act. 
Self-efficacy is also important when it comes to implementing inno vative
instructional techniques. K undu and R oy (2023) used a 25-item inno vative self -
efficacy scale and previous research and determined that inno vation relies hea vily
on the teacher ’s self- efficacy and abilit y to engage in reflectiv e activities.
Collectiv e efficacy is when a group believ es in each other ’s skills and abilit y.
(Goddard et al. (2000) found that teachers’ beliefs about their facult y’s capabilit y
to educate students constitute a norm that influences the actions and
achiev ements of schools (p . 502).  
Schwabasky et al. (2020) suggests that collectiv e efficacy can be dev eloped b y
having teachers participate in inno vations together , then celebr ating and
publicizing the inno vations. Inno vation cannot happen without trust between
colleagues because there is a fear of vulner ability (Bryk and Schneider , 2002). 
Historically , teaching has been an isolating career . Teachers work alone in their
classroom with their door shut with little free time for lunch, let alone intentional,well-constructed work that creates tr ansformation in the school communit y. This
isolation has been referred to as “egg cr ate classrooms” (T yack, 1974). W e need to
de-priv atize these classrooms because when teachers trust each other and
collabor ate it benefits students (McLesk ey, 2017). Opposite the egg cr ate is the
beehiv e, where there is collabor ative work tow ards a common goal. A beehiv e
school builds trust because it is a place where people know their role and know
how it fits in the larger picture (Johnson, 2019, pp . 5-6).  
Teacher leadership is seen as an opportunit y for professional growth to help retain
high qualit y educators (Leida, 2018). Howev er, sometimes poor ex ecution of the
creation of these positions can cause further issues. When teachers are giv en
extra stipends and/or roles, some report that they are seen b y their colleagues as
favorites of the principal, and which fosters distrust and jealousy , mostly because
there are no clear structures for how teachers can earn these positions, or how the
decisions are made (Johnson & Donaldson, 2007; Murph y et al, 2009). ""R esearch
knowledge must be ""tr anslated"" to teacher -friendly instructional forms to be
implemented in classrooms (Abbott et al, 1999, p . 340). Ev en if teachers ha ve the
training to properly interpret and tr anslate research into pr actice, the limitations
on time prev ent maximum diffusion of those pr actices. 
Special education teachers report feeling particularly disenfr anchised and burnt
out from not feeling v alued in their schools (Hester et al. , 2020). Much of this
burnout and disenfr anchisement could stem from the fact that administr ators are
less lik ely to effectiv ely determine their capacit y as a special educator , or to be
able to pro vide essential feedback for professional growth (R odl et al. , 2018).  
Special education teachers frequently report not being treated as equals as their
gener al education peers (Johnson, 2019, p .17). When it comes to special
education teachers, there ma y be a certain lev el of “ableism b y proxy” directed
towards the special education teachers due to the populations they serv e, as well
as “othering” that occurs.  
Students with disabilities spend a large portion of their da y in the gener al
education classroom, y et gener al education teachers only receiv e an a verage of
one and a half classes related to teaching students with disabilities (R osenzweig,
2009), and man y times their preservice progr am focused on content areas,
whereas special education teachers t ypically ha ve focused on the evidence-based
instructional str ategies that would best serv e all students.  
In addition, ev en though a special education teachers’ tr aining inherently prepares
them with skills that are also needed for leadership roles in schools, they are less
likely to be called upon b y administr ators to serv e in those positions (Maggins &
Hughes, 2020), making them feel under appreciated (Hester et al. , 2020). They
specifically cite lack of administr ative support, workload, conflicts with gener al
education colleagues as sources of burnout and stress (Hester et al. , 2020).  
Ingersoll et al. (2017) found that including teachers in decision-making related to
school impro vement and structures is an important part of teacher retention. Y et,
many special education teachers are left out of decisions, and report that their
administr ators do not know the la ws, policies, and pr actices required of them or
how to ev aluate them (R odl et al, 2018).  
Co-teaching requires special and gener al education teachers to co-plan, co-
construct, and co- assess (Mur awski, 2003). In effectiv e co-teaching, both teachers
provide instruction to students with and without disabilities (Fluijt et al. , 2016;
Jortveit & K ovač, 2022). In order for co-teaching to be successful, there must be a
commitment to time, professional learning, and inclusiv e practices not only b y theteachers, but also the principals and other professionals in the school (Jurk owski
et al., 2023). Ev en something as simple as how the ph ysical en vironment is set up
can either facilitate or limit productiv e co-teaching (The P oole, Ev ertson, and the
IRIS Center , 2019).
Effectiv e professional dev elopment follows man y of the same best pr actices
teachers are expected to use for their students. F or example, to motiv ate teachers
to be intrinsically interested in the learning, it in volves activities that are tailored
to the needs and interests of the teacher , incorpor ates input and choice regarding
what and how information is learned, is authentic and builds connections between
expectations and the skills needed to achiev e the expectations, and engages in a
variety of w ays through action, discussion, visuals, and socially (Darling-Hammond
et al., 2017; Hunzick er, 2010).  
Teachers are more lik ely to change their professional pr actice when they engage in
professional learning that pro vides opportunities for reflection on current pr actices
collabor atively with other teachers (Mey er, et al. , 2023; Sims et al. , 2021). Sims et
al. (2021) also found that “collectiv e participation of groups of teachers from the
same school, subject, or gr ade is related both to coherence and activ e learning
opportunities, which in turn are related to impro vements in teacher knowledge and
skill and changes in classroom pr actice, ” (p. 936). When two or more teachers are
called upon to work together tow ards a common goal, there must be a common
language dev eloped between them.","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
Before beginning, participants will receiv e a list of questions related to their co-
teaching relationship and pr actices, as well as questions asking them to reflect on
their satisfaction with their current pr actices and roles.
Participants will then ha ve a short meeting where they will be pro vided the

Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
This will be a qualitativ e study that is phenomenological because it will focus on
the experiences of educators from their personal perspectiv es, while also
attempting to mak e meaning and dev elop a theory about those experiences.
Participants will share their accounts experiencing the shared phenomenon of co-
teaching. There is an element of co-construction of realit y due to the wide and
ambiguous definition of co-teaching as currently pr acticed. This research will seek
to understand their experiences while exploring methods that could potentially
impro ve those experiences for all those who co-teach.
Instruments will be open-ended to allow participants to driv e the direction and
topic of focus based on their experiences and perspectiv es. Various t ypes of
collection will occur to try to capture the nuances of the perspectiv es and their
impact on the participants' inter actions and experiences. F or example, participants
will ha ve the chance to share their perspectiv es through writing, submitting
documents and/or photogr aphs, and or ally.

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
This study aims to address the issue of teacher retention at Phillips High
School, a Midwestern urban school facing challenges with high teacher
turno ver. Currently , the school’ s retention r ate is 76.9%, which falls short of
the ideal target of 90.2%. T eacher retention is crucial in urban schools, as
frequent turno ver disrupts student learning, str ains remaining staff , and
negativ ely impacts school culture. R esearch indicates that factors such as
workload management, stress, and lack of support contribute significantly to
teacher burnout and attrition. Motiv ated b y these findings, this study focuses
on implementing a professional dev elopment interv ention designed to
enhance teacher job satisfaction, reduce burnout, and foster a supportiv e
work en vironment.
The interv ention consists of two professional dev elopment sessions focused
on workload management and stress reduction techniques, coupled with
strategies for effectiv e communication with administr ators. During these
sessions, teachers will learn pr actical tools for organizing and prioritizing
tasks, setting boundaries, and managing their workload through calendar -
based planning. Additionally , teachers will explore w ays to constructiv ely
communicate their needs to school administr ators, empowering them to
advocate for the support necessary to maintain a sustainable and positiv e
work experience. P ost-interv ention activities include one-on-one interviews
and a follow -up surv ey to assess changes in teachers’ perceptions of job
satisfaction, stress lev els, and their intentions to remain at the school.
The study’ s design is qualitativ e and utiliz es a combination of surv eys,
interviews, and observ ational data from the professional dev elopment
sessions to ev aluate the interv ention’ s impact. By comparing pre- and post -
interv ention data, this study seeks to pro vide actionable insights into how
structured support can impro ve teacher satisfaction and retention in an
urban school context.
This project has significant implications for educational leadership and policy
in urban districts. If successful, the interv ention model could serv e as a
framework for other high-need schools aiming to retain qualified and
committed educators. By focusing on teacher well-being and creating a
culture of support, schools ma y be able to impro ve retention r ates, thereb y

Purpose and Liter ature R eview
 
The purpose of this research is to address the critical issue of teacher
retention in urban high schools, with a specific focus on implementing
professional dev elopment interv entions at Phillips High School to enhance
job satisfaction and reduce burnout. This project builds upon existing
literature on teacher retention, examining the role of leadership , professional
development, and supportiv e environments in influencing teachers' decisions
to remain in their positions. The research seeks to narrow the retention gap ,
impro ving the current r ate from 76.9% closer to the ideal 90.2% b y
equipping teachers with pr actical workload management tools and fostering
a supportiv e school culture.
 
Existing R esearch and Liter ature
 
Teacher R etention Challenges in Urban Schools
Teacher turno ver remains a significant issue in urban schools, disrupting
continuit y in student learning and placing a str ain on remaining staff .
Research highlights that urban schools often face additional stressors,
including limited resources and heightened beha vioral challenges, which
exacerbate burnout among teachers. High turno ver rates affect school
stabilit y, weak en student -teacher relationships, and challenge o verall school
impro vement efforts. This interv ention aims to address these challenges b y
implementing str ategies tailored to urban school contexts, where retaining
qualified and experienced teachers is crucial.
 
Impact of T ransformational Leadership 
One of the primary influences on teacher retention, according to extensiv e
research, is the st yle and qualit y of school leadership . Transformational
leadership , which includes attributes such as inspir ational motiv ation,
intellectual stimulation, and individualiz ed consider ation, has been shown to
positiv ely impact teacher motiv ation, job satisfaction, and retention. Studies
by Kwan (2020) and T oprak et al. (2023) demonstr ate that tr ansformational
leadership fosters a positiv e school culture, reducing turno ver intentions b y
promoting an en vironment where teachers feel v alued and supported.
Research indicates that when school leaders prioritiz e supportiv e and
collabor ative environments, teachers are more lik ely to feel committed to
their roles. This interv ention will support teachers’ professional and
emotional needs b y incorpor ating elements of tr ansformational leadership ,
thereb y fostering an en vironment that encour ages sustained commitment.
 
Professional Dev elopment as a R etention T ool
Professional dev elopment has been widely recogniz ed as a k ey factor in
reducing teacher burnout and enhancing retention. Studies b y Flores and
Shuls (2023) and Abor amadan et al. (2020) underscore the importance of
targeted professional dev elopment opportunities that address the specificneeds of educators, particularly in challenging en vironments lik e urban
schools. These studies indicate that when teachers are equipped with
practical skills and feel supported in their professional growth, they are more
likely to remain in their positions. This interv ention incorpor ates professional
development focused on workload management and stress reduction, both
identified as critical areas for teachers in high-demand settings.
 
Workload Management and Supportiv e School Culture  
Effectiv e workload management is another essential factor influencing
teacher retention. R esearch suggests that teachers who feel o verwhelmed
by their responsibilities are more susceptible to burnout. Studies ha ve
shown that pr actical str ategies for organizing tasks and setting boundaries
around workload can significantly impro ve teachers' job satisfaction and
mental health. Additionally , establishing a supportiv e school culture where
teachers can openly communicate their needs to administr ators has been
identified as a k ey str ategy for retention. This interv ention integr ates
workload management techniques with communication str ategies,
empowering teachers to adv ocate for their needs and contributing to a
school culture that v alues their well-being.
 
Contribution to the Body of Knowledge
 
This research builds upon and contributes to the existing body of liter ature
by specifically focusing on the intersection of tr ansformational leadership ,
workload management, and professional dev elopment within an urban high
school context. By addressing the unique challenges faced b y teachers in
these settings, this study seeks to dev elop a replicable model of support that
can be applied across similar urban schools experiencing high turno ver
rates. Moreo ver, it extends the application of tr ansformational leadership
principles b y tailoring them to the professional dev elopment needs of
teachers, highlighting the role of supportiv e environments and workload
management str ategies in fostering retention. 
 
Through this interv ention, this study aims to pro vide actionable insights that
will contribute to dev eloping sustainable solutions for retaining teachers in
high-need urban schools, ensuring a stable, committed teaching workforce
that ultimately benefits the students they serv e.","and Student/Staff Involvement

Research Methodology
1.
Professional Development Sessions :
The interv ention includes two professional dev elopment sessions that
focus on workload management, stress reduction, and communication
strategies with administr ators. Observ ational data will be collected
during these sessions, capturing immediate responses, engagement
levels, and an y shared insights from teachers. Observ ational notes will
focus on participant inter action, the themes emerging from group
discussions, and teachers' engagement with the material.
2.
Post-Intervention Surveys :
Following the professional dev elopment sessions, teachers will complete
a post -interv ention surv ey. This surv ey will include Lik ert-scale
questions and open-ended questions that assess changes in job
satisfaction, perceiv ed stress lev els, effectiv eness in managing
workload, and intentions to remain in their teaching roles. Lik ert-scale
responses pro vide quantitativ e data on changes in attitudes, while
open-ended questions allow for personaliz ed, qualitativ e feedback on
the interv ention's impact.
3.
One-on-One Interviews :
After the professional dev elopment sessions, individual in-depth
interviews will be conducted with each participant. These interviews will
explore teachers' reflections on the interv ention’ s effectiv eness, an y
adjustments they ha ve made to their workload management pr actices,
satisfaction with their roles, and impro vements in their communication
with administr ators. Interview questions are cr afted to encour age open-
ended responses, allowing teachers to share detailed insights on how
the interv ention influenced their job experience and retention
intentions.
Analytical Techniques1.
Thematic Analysis :
Thematic analysis will be the primary technique used to analyz e
qualitativ e data from interviews, open-ended surv ey responses, and
observ ational notes. This process in volves coding the data to identif y
recurring themes and patterns related to job satisfaction, workload
management, stress reduction, and intentions to sta y. Coding will be
conducted manually , and themes will be iter atively refined to accur ately
reflect participants' experiences. Anticipated themes ma y include
practical str ategies for managing stress, setting boundaries around
workload, and impro vements in communication with school leadership .
2.
Descriptive Statistics :
Likert-scale data from the post -interv ention surv ey will be analyz ed
using descriptiv e statistics to pro vide an o verall summary of job
satisfaction, perceiv ed stress, and retention intentions among the
teachers. Measures such as means, medians, and standard deviations
will help quantif y any observ ed shifts in attitudes and experiences
following the interv ention. These summary statistics will complement
the thematic analysis b y offering a quantifiable perspectiv e on the
interv ention’ s effects.
Conclusion
The use of thematic analysis and descriptiv e statistics pro vides a balanced
approach to ev aluating both qualitativ e and quantitativ e data from the
study . This methodology is suited to capture the immediate and lasting
effects of the professional dev elopment sessions on teachers’ perceptions of
their roles, workload management pr actices, and job satisfaction. By
examining teachers' feedback and responses, the study aims to gener ate
valuable insights into sustainable pr actices for impro ving teacher retention in
urban school en vironments, offering pr actical guidance for school leaders
and policymak ers focused on supporting educators in high-need schools."

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Working closely with CPS teachers, this research adv ances the co-design,
implementation, documentation, and sharing of curricular and pedagogical
models that support expansiv e learning at the intersections of STEAM
(science, technology , engineering, arts and math), critical social analysis,
reading and writing. This vision seeks to address the field- wide need to: 1)
expand critical civics learning across disciplinary domains; 2) design for
robust forms of liter acy learning within STEAM projects that support y oung
people to analyz e and tr ansform the social issues they see as pressing within
their communities; and 3) carefully document and share the pedagogical
practices that support deep learning at the intersections of STEAM, critical
literacies and civics education.
 
This initial phase of the project (supported b y the CPS + North western R apid
Research Gr ant) begins with teachers at four high schools. This core group
of (6-7) teachers ha ve a shared commitment to dev eloping expansiv e
learning experiences that lev erage multiple disciplinary tools and
perspectiv es (scientific and mathematical concepts and pr actices, critical
texts and written genres, social scientific inquiry , etc.), supporting high
school students to analyz e and address the social issues that impact their
everyday lives, and creating resources for teachers in vested in similar
visions within and bey ond their schools. 
 
Specifically , we will implement and document processes of co-design with a
small group of teachers, students and families from each school in Summer
2020. This co-design process is aimed at curricular units and pedagogical
practices that support robust and rigorous forms of tr ansdisciplinary
learning. In partnership with teachers, we will also minimally document
implementation in the 2020-2021 school y ear through curricular documents
and student focus groups, with appropriate permissions from students and
parents/caregiv ers, and with appropriate adjustments for shifts in learning
arrangements based on the COVID-19 pandemic.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
This project initiated and dev eloped a partnership between North western
University and local high school teachers working tow ards critical
interdisciplinary learning. Our broader vision adv ances the co-design,
implementation, documentation, and sharing of curricular and pedagogical
models that support expansiv e learning at the intersections of STEM, critical
social analysis, reading and writing. Supporting teacher dev elopment in this
area requires opportunities for co-design and learning among teachers, and
for meaningfully collabor ating with students, families and communit y
members to dev elop projects that address local concerns and visions. The
key questions guiding our project therefore included: What forms of
thinking, learning and action emerge at the intersections of these domains?
How can we best support teachers to co-design, implement and reflect on
such learning? Giv en the constr aints of COVID-19 during the 2 y ear timeline
of our project, our design and documentation focused on 1) bringing
together teachers across schools to engage in co-design of tr ansdisciplinary
curriculum; and 2) supporting teachers to engage in co-design with a team
of colleagues, students and in some cases, parents/caregiv ers at their
respectiv e schools. Since we were not able to document co-design processes
or implementation at the school lev el, our research focused on the teacher
co-design and ongoing reflection, artifacts created, as well as k ey reflections
from student participants in focus groups.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
This project addresses a number of inter -related problems of pr actice. First,
we know that curriculum and pedagogy are most effectiv e and equitable
when they are meaningfully connected to students liv es and communit y
histories, particularly for students underrepresented within STEM fields.
Socially and cultur ally engaged STEM learning holds great promise both for
deepening student engagement and for expanding the disciplinary domains
themselv es to address pressing global and local issues. While NGS S supports
deeper connections to professional pr actice, the need to dev elop STEM
learners and professionals equipped to wrestle with the complex social and
ethical issues of our time is a leading edge of the field. Mo ving in this
direction requires additional skillsets and opportunities for both students and
teachers, including how to support meaningful discussion, thinking and
learning at the intersection of science, math and critical social analysis, and
how to support students to engage in critical reading and writing that
deepens their STEM ideas, questions and projects. Efforts to deepen and
expand civic education also require an interdisciplinary view of social
analysis, action and imagination. F or social science, civics and English
teachers, working closely with STEM teachers therefore allows for deeper
connections across domains, and positions reading and writing as more than
prepar ation to engage in other content areas, but as rigorous skillsets crucial
to critical thinking across fields.
Supporting teacher dev elopment in this area also requires opportunities for
co-learning among teachers, for experiencing one another ’s practice, and for
meaningfully collabor ating with students, families and communit y members
to design projects that address local concerns and visions. Finally ,
supporting such learning at scale requires that we not only dev elop and
share models of rich curriculum, but also pro vide example-rich syntheses of
pedagogical pr actice and tools for recognizing the rich forms of student
thinking and learning that can emerge across domains.
 
The last decade has seen a rise in educational research and design that
conceptualiz es equit y in STEM as tied to a critical widening of the disciplines
and professions themselv es, whether in science (Medin and Bang 2014;
Morales-Do yle, 2017); making and computer science (V ossoughi, Hooper ,
and Escudé 2016; Pinkard et al. 2017;); engineering (Philip et al. 2018) or
mathematics (Gutiérrez 2017; Gutstein 2012; Nasir 2002). R ather than
treating STEM knowledge and pr actices as settled (Bang et al. 2012), this
body of work crucially asks: Which histories and w ays of knowing are v alued
or erased? And, STEM for what purposes? (Sengupta- Irving & V ossoughi,
2019). These questions align with the broader imper ative to support
students engage deeply with disciplinary domains in w ays that are rooted in
rather than separ ate from their histories and communities.
Though these contributions and the man y educational projects that resonatewith them ha ve expanded the meanings and purposes of STEM learning, less
often does the liter ature address the role of critical reading and writing
within such expanded visions for STEM. In pr actice, there are a growing
number of STEM teachers who aim to dev elop curriculum and pedagogy that
is socially and cultur ally relev ant, but who ma y not feel equipped to facilitate
the kinds of social analytic inquiry and civic dialogue that such work
requires. Our own research interviewing STEM professionals with a social
justice orientation has rev ealed that man y name particular social scientific
texts as piv otal to their own thinking and work regarding social problems
such as w aste-water treatment or en vironmental r acism. This is also a
challenge at the univ ersity level, where STEM students who are interested in
social, political and ethical questions ma y have little room to tak e courses in
social science, or Ethnic studies. As teachers within our recent co-design
session ask ed, “what kinds of mathematicians, scientists, and architects are
we dev eloping?” In line with the emergent CPS equit y framework,
discovering and cultiv ating the unique gifts, talents and interests of ev ery
young person requires a view of STEM disciplines as not only open to
students’ real interests and concerns, but as heterogenous and ev olving
domains of knowledge that require the intellectual and cultur al ways of
knowing of div erse communities. From this perspectiv e, holistic learning and
identit y dev elopment and deep academic engagement are closely
intertwined (Nasir , et. al. , 2006).  
This project aims to address these gaps b y working closely with teachers to
co-design, implement and document curriculum and pedagogy that
meaningfully integr ates STEM learning with critical liter acies. T o this end, we
ask: What forms of thinking, learning and action emerge at the intersections
of these domains? How can we best support teachers to design, implement
and reflect on such learning?","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
The following is the original timeline of research activities, followed b y
phases of data analysis and writing that ha ve continued until the present:
April- July 2020: Prepar ation and co-design meetings with lead teacher to
develop plan for co-designing with students, teachers and families at their
schools. 
Late July 2020: Launch our summer design institute with teachers, students
and family members (parents/caregiv ers). K ey goals in volve 1) Collectiv ely
envisioning educational possibilit y; 2) Engaging in historical and communit y
based research that supports curricular and pedagogical design; 3) Co-
developing and iter ating units that will be implemented in the F all
2020/Winter 2021; and 4) Building communit y across school teams through
processes of reflection and feedback on curriculum and pedagogy . During
July we also plan to apply for additional funding to expand the project in the
future. 
 
August & September 2020: W rap up co-design work and teacher focus
groups.
 
Fall 2020: Begin data analysis of summer co-design and teacher focus
groups, dev elop approach to student focus groups. Gain IRB and RRB
appro val for student focus group . 
 
Winter 2021: Complete data analysis of summer co-design process and
teacher focus groups. Conduct student focus groups and wea ve in the
analysis of focus group data. Begin dev eloping final report for CPS .","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
Our initial phase responds to our research questions using a participatory
design methodology (Bang & V ossoughi, 2016). This approach treats
teachers, students and families as co-designers of academically rigorous and
equitable learning, and understands processes of partnering  as key foci of
documentation. W e will dr aw on qualitativ e methodologies of data collection
(fieldnotes, audio recordings and focus groups) to document the process of
co-design during the Spring and Summer of 2020. This documentation will
allow us to tr ace the genesis of rich models for conceptualizing critical
interdisciplinary learning as well as the dev elopment of specific curricular
and pedagogical approaches. W e are particularly interested in understanding
the conditions that support meaningful co-design among teachers, students,
family and communit y members and learning scientists during the summer
institute. Here it is important to note that the core group of teachers named
above bring a wealth of experience with critical forms of STEM, Social
Science and English teaching, and are eager to collectiv ely deepen their
practice and offer resources for the field. This str and of work will yield an
expected product  that articulates the method of co-design across k ey
stakeholders, and offers k ey insights into democr atizing decision-making
around curriculum and pedagogy , as well as supporting teacher learning and
leadership dev elopment. This phase will be followed b y analysis and student
focus groups in F all 2020 and Winter 2021 (see previous pages for detailed
description of focus group methods). 
 
Here are some additional language around methods from the North western
appro ved IRB protocol:
 
For CPS teachers,  we will not be recording or documenting their co-design
sessions with high school students during summer of 2020 due to CPS’
current restrictions on virtual v olunteering. Howev er, during the time when
teachers are engaging in co-design with students (end of July -August 2020),
we will hold weekly 1-hour focus groups with the teachers. These focus
groups (3-4 total) will create a space for teachers to share their professional
expertise and reflections on the co-design process. T eachers will be ask ed to
speak in gener al terms r ather than describe inter actions with specific
students (see focus group protocol). If an y student names are mentioned,
they will not be included in the data that is analyz ed. These sessions will
provide data on teachers’ reflections/perspectiv es regarding the process of
co-designing interdisciplinary curriculum with students.
Where full consent is pro vided for audio recording focus groups with
teachers and students: 
The use of audio recordings within the data analysis will tak e a number of
different forms. A udio will be used to supplement the information that w asgathered through r aw jottings in order to dev elop a more comprehensiv e
fieldnote. This will in volve listening to the audio and writing pla y by play
accounts of ev ents as well as our interpretations of those ev ents. The
research team will catalogue and mak e activit y logs for all audio recordings.
Similar to the fieldnotes, activit y logs segment a giv en audio recording
based on 2-3 minutes chunks that align with natur al shifts in activit y and
summariz e what participants were sa ying and doing during that time. These
activit y logs will then be utiliz ed within our data analysis softw are alongside
fieldnotes and other data to help us identif y the t ypicalit y and at ypicalit y of
our qualitativ e codes. In addition, creation of activit y logs serv es as a
process through which to identif y particular segments for closer micro-
ethnogr aphic analysis. F ocus groups with enrolled teachers and students will
also be tr anscribed and coded as part of the data set, with an ey e tow ards
answering our research questions."

design, and implications of the project.
Rates of mental health problems in children are rising, and most children do not ha ve
access to treatment, problems that disproportionately impact children of color . Barriers to
care include low mental health liter acy, stigma, and shortage of affordable and con venient
mental health care. Public health experts ha ve pointed to the importance of strengthening
comprehensiv e school mental health systems to impro ve youth mental health, address
barriers, and increase access to services amid the current mental health crisis.
Social Emotional Learning (SEL) progr ams, focused on social and emotional skill
development, and Mental Health Liter acy (MHL) interv entions, designed to pro vide
psychoeducation about mental health, are two complementary categories of univ ersal
school-based interv entions for impro ving student mental health. There is strong evidence
that SEL progr ams impro ve mental health and academic functioning. Howev er, evidence
for the effect of MHL interv entions on stigma and help-seeking beha vior is more limited. 
Furthermore, the majorit y of MHL interv entions are short -term and are not deliv ered b y
classroom teachers. T o date, there is a lack of interv entions that combine SEL and MHL
content and can be feasibly deliv ered b y educators to impro ve mental health, reduce
stigma, and encour age help-seeking beha vior. 
To address these gaps, the team at Lurie Children’ s Hospital Center for Childhood
Resilience (CCR) partnered with Chicago Public Schools, the fourth largest public school
district in the US , to dev elop and pilot the Stress and Coping T oolkit (SCT). SCT is
designed for ease of deliv ery by classroom teachers. It expands upon SEL curricula b y
integr ating MHL as well as inclusion of content related to coping with stress, tr auma, and
grief. SCT builds the capacit y of educators to deliv er prev entive mental health
progr amming and connect students to additional services if needed. Pilot testing
demonstr ated ex cellent feasibilit y and acceptabilit y and promoted referr al of students to
mental health services.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Aim 1. T o test whether SCT impro ves mental health liter acy and help-seeking attitudes and
behaviors. A t baseline and follow -up (6 months), we will collect student reports of mental
health liter acy, student and teacher reports of help-seeking stigma, and student report of
help-seeking beha vior.
Hypothesis: The interv ention group will demonstr ate impro ved mental health liter acy,
reduced mental health stigma and more student help-seeking.
Aim 2. T o test whether SCT impro ves emotional and academic functioning. A t baseline and
follow up , students will complete measures of SEL competencies and social, emotional,
and
behavioral functioning. A t the conclusion of the academic y ear, we will abstr act school
records of student academic functioning (attendance, disciplinary referr als, and gr ades).
Hypothesis: The interv ention group will show more growth in SEL competencies,
reductions in mental health symptoms, and impro vements in academic functioning
compared to the control.
Aim 3. T o examine feasibilit y, acceptabilit y, and adoption of SCT . We will assess feasibilit y,
acceptabilit y, and adoption of the SCT via process outcomes, student and teacher surv eys,
and student and teacher focus groups.
Hypothesis: Consistent with pilot research, process outcomes will support feasibilit y,
implementing teachers will report high lev els of acceptabilit y and adoption, and students
will report high acceptabilit y of the SCT .","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is
the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body of
extant knowledge?
Youth Mental Health: A National Emergency
Experts in children’ s health ha ve declared a national emergency in child and adolescent
mental health.8 R ates of mental health problems in children and adolescents ha ve risen
steadily in recent decades. During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency visits for mental
health related concerns rose precipitously , reflecting the toll of stressors associated with
COVID-19 on y outh. Early in the pandemic, Lurie Children’ s Hospital partnered with
Chicago Public Schools, a district made up primarily of economically disadv antaged (73%)
youth of color (89%), to examine the effect of school closure on student mental health.
The resulting surv ey of o ver 32,000 caregiv ers demonstr ated that student mental health
and well-being were significantly worse after remote learning compared to before, and
exposure to COVID-19 stressors w as associated with decreased student well-being.
Exposure to T rauma and S ystemic Inequities in Access to Mental Health Care
Youth of color and those living in po verty disproportionately experience adv ersity, trauma,
and grief . Stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, in combination with
longstanding inequities and structur al racism in the healthcare and education systems,
have exacerbated mental health concerns for man y young people. Y outh of color and
youth experiencing po verty are less lik ely to access qualit y mental health interv entions
and are more lik ely to receiv e mental health services only in the school setting. S ystemic
barriers to qualit y mental health care include affordabilit y, difficult y accessing clinic
appointments outside of school hours, lower r ates of early identification and referr al for
mental health care, and mistrust of healthcare pro viders that hinders help seeking. 
The Promise of School Mental Health Progr ams 
Public health experts ha ve recommended increasing implementation of effectiv e school-
based mental health care to address the y outh mental health crisis. Schools impro ve
access to mental health care b y making treatment and prev entive interv ention a vailable in
the spaces where y outh spend most of their time. R esearch has demonstr ated the positiv e
impacts of classroom-based interv entions on mental health outcomes. Univ ersal
preventive mental health progr ams that are deliv ered b y educational staff , rather than
outside pro viders, ha ve the added benefit of being facilitated b y trusted adults centr al to
the liv es of adolescents.
There are two t ypes of univ ersal progr amming commonly deliv ered in schools. Social
Emotional Learning (SEL) progr ams are designed to help y oung people dev elop skills such
as emotional a wareness and expression, problem-solving, and responsible decision-
making. Mental Health Liter acy (MHL) interv entions are designed to pro vide
psychoeducation about mental health to increase capacit y to maintain positiv e mental
health, decrease stigma about mental disorders, and enhance help seeking beha viors. SEL
interv entions are t ypically implemented b y trained classroom teachers o ver the course of
an academic y ear while MHL progr ams are t ypically short -term (1-3 sessions)7 and
frequently require more specializ ed mental health tr aining prior to deliv ery. A recent
review found that only 15% of MHL progr ams were facilitated b y classroom teachers. 
There is strong evidence that SEL progr ams can impro ve mental health and academic
functioning, but evidence for the effect of MHL progr ams on stigma and help-seeking
behavior is still emerging. SEL progr ams ha ve historically not included mental health
information, such as psy choeducation about tr auma and ha ve not been designed to
address mental health stigma and other barriers to mental health services. T o address
these gaps, we dev eloped a univ ersal prev entive mental health interv ention that combines
elements of SEL and MHL progr amming and can be feasibly deliv ered b y educators. The
goal of the progr am w as to impro ve student social and emotional skills, reduce access
barriers such as low mental health liter acy and stigma, and impro ve help-seekingbehavior.","and Student/Staff Involvement

data collection from students and teachers regarding student mental health liter acy,
stigma and help-seeking attitudes, social emotional competence, student functioning, and
satisfaction with the Stress and Coping T oolkit. The main study outcome measures and
assessment timepoints are listed below .
Demogr aphic Questionnaire. Students and teachers will complete a brief demogr aphic
questionnaire at baseline. Students and teachers will report age, gender/gender identit y,
race, and ethnicit y. Teachers will also report on y ears of experience in the education field.
Mental Health Liter acy. Students and teachers will complete an adapted v ersion of the
Mental Health Liter acy Questionnaire (MHLq) at baseline and follow -up. This v alidated
survey assesses fiv e aspects of mental health liter acy: knowledge of mental health
problems, erroneous beliefs/stereot ypes, first aid skills and help seeking beha vior, and
self-help str ategies.
Mental Health Help Seeking Beha vior. Students will complete the Gener al Help- Seeking
Questionnaire (GHSQ) at baseline and follow -up. The GHSQ assesses recent help-seeking
behavior and sources of help sought. The GHSQ has demonstr ated acceptable reliabilit y
and v alidity in prior research. 
Help Seeking Stigma. Students and teachers will complete the 5-item P erceptions of
Stigmatization b y Others for Seeking Help Scale at baseline and follow -up. The measure
has demonstr ated good internal consistency and test -retest reliabilit y.
Social Emotional Skills. Students will complete the W ashoe Count y School District Social
and Emotional Competency Assessment (WCSD- SECA) at baseline and follow -up. The
WCSD- SECA is a 40-item v alidated measure that assesses self -awareness of strengths and
weaknesses, self -awareness of emotions, self -management of emotions, self -management
of goals, self -management of schoolwork, relationship skills, social a wareness, and
responsible decision-making.
Social, Emotional, and Beha vioral Functioning. Students will complete the 25-item
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a brief self -rating of student risk for social,
emotional, and beha vioral problems. The SDQ is a v alidated measure of mental and
behavioral health commonly used in schools, consisting of a broad scale (T otal Difficulties)
and fiv e subscales (Emotional S ymptoms, Conduct Problems, Hyper activit y/Inattention,
Peer R elationship Problems, and Prosocial Beha vior).  
Feasibilit y and Acceptabilit y. Students and teachers in the interv ention group will complete
the Stress and Coping T oolkit Satisfaction Surv ey dev eloped b y the PI at the conclusion of
the interv ention. In addition, implementing teachers and a r andom selection of students
from interv ention classrooms will be in vited to participate in a focus group at the
conclusion of the interv ention to share their perspectiv es on the Stress and Coping T oolkit
progr am.
Adoption. T eachers in the interv ention group will complete a monthly implementation
tracking surv ey to report on the activities they implemented during the prior month.Qualitativ e Data:  All 18 teachers form the interv ention schools will be in vited to
participate in a focus group . Two focus groups will be conducted to examine teachers'
positiv e and negativ e experiences with the interv ention and its implementation, and
recommendations for future implementation. F ocus groups will be conducted virtually via

number of absences, number of suspensions.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical techniques
that will be utilized as part of this study.
We propose a study to ev aluate effectiv eness of the Stress and Coping T oolkit, a teacher -
delivered, classroom-based mental health liter acy and social emotional learning
interv ention for sixth through eighth gr ade students. W e will simultaneously be
studying implementation factors (acceptabilit y, feasibilit y) and effectiv eness (the impact of
the interv ention on student outcomes). 
We will utiliz e a Matched P air Cluster R andomization approach. In other words, six schools
will be recruited for the research, with three participating classrooms per school. The
matched pair design means that schools will be r anked and paired based on the
percentage of students receiving free/reduced lunch and performance on statewide
academic assessments, resulting in three pairs of schools. Within each pair , one school will
be randomly assigned to participate in the Stress and Coping T oolkit interv ention. The non-
selected schools will serv e as the control group and will receiv e training in the Stress and
Coping T oolkit outside the research context at the conclusion of the study .
Three selected classrooms from within both interv ention and control schools will
participate in data collection at two timepoints within the school y ear (baseline and follow -
up). Informed consent will be obtained from all students in these classrooms, in addition
to the classroom teacher . All teachers from interv ention schools will be in vited to
participate in a focus group . Two students per interv ention classroom will be r andomly
selected to participate in student interviews.
The classrooms within the interv ention schools will participate in teacher -deliv ered
activities from the Stress and Coping T oolkit once per week throughout the school y ear.
To account for nested data (students within classrooms and schools), we will utiliz e
Multilev el Modeling (MLM) to assess whether the interv ention has an effect on mental
health liter acy, stigma, and help-seeking beha vior (Aim 1) and social-emotional
competencies and mental health (Aim 2). The response in the model is the change in score
(post interv ention – pre-interv ention). Lev el 1 units are represented b y students, Lev el 2
units are represented b y classrooms, and Lev el 3 units are represented b y schools.
Covariates in the model will include treatment group , grade lev el and gender . The
coefficient for the treatment group will represent the interv ention effect. Intr aclass
correlation coefficients will be calculated to estimate the proportion of v ariation in the
response explained b y the v ariation in a lev el. Feasibilit y, acceptabilit y, and adoption (Aim
3) will be explored based on descriptiv e statistics from student and teacher satisfaction
surveys and process outcomes such as teacher attendance at tr aining. T eacher focus
groups and student interviews will be audio-recorded and tr anscribed, and A TLAS
qualitativ e softw are progr am will be utiliz ed to facilitate thematic coding utilizing an

The Inclusiv e Econom y Lab (IEL) has partnered with the Illinois Department of Human
Services' Office to Prev ent and End Homelessness (IDHS OPEH) to launch and ev aluate the
third round of the Stabilit y Investment for F amily Housing (SIFH). This progr am will assess
the impact of a one-time substantial cash tr ansfer on the well-being of families and
students experiencing homelessness, as defined b y the McKinney -Vento Act. The study
aims to determine whether this financial assistance can prev ent families and students from
entering shelters, promote long-term housing stabilit y, and impro ve students’ educational
outcomes and other aspects of their well-being. Additionally , it seeks to gener ate insights
that will inform the dev elopment of progr ams and policies to help families stabiliz e their
housing situations. Giv en the limited funds a vailable for this pilot, and the number of
families that qualif y for a progr am lik e this, the progr am will be designed, implemented,
and ev aluated through a r andomiz ed control trial (RCT) with three groups: a main-
treatment group of appro ximately 759 families receiving $6,500, a light -treatment group
of 759 families receiving $500, and a control group of 759 families that will not receiv e
any cash tr ansfer . A lottery allows us to distribute the limited amount of funds in an
equitable and fair w ay, while also allowing us to rigorously ev aluate the impact of this
progr am so it can pro vide evidence for scale and permanency .  
IEL has partnered with Giv eDirectly (GD), an NGO specializing in cash pa yment progr ams,
to manage the progr am implementation of the SIFH R ound 3 pilot. Along with IEL, GD
plans to collabor ate with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Office of Student Support and
Engagement (OS SE) to identif y appro ximately 100 schools (or less) for participation in the
pilot progr am. Since the progr am focuses on families and students experiencing
homelessness, GD and OS SE will target CPS schools with a significant number of Students
in Tempor ary Living Situations (STLS). T o ensure enough participants enroll in the pilot,
principals and STLS adv ocates at the selected schools will be tr ained to communicate the
pilot's objectiv es and encour age eligible families to apply , with a goal of recruiting around
2,277 participants. 
This project will unfold in three phases:  
Phase I: October 2024 – December 2024 
Conduct outreach to principals to gauge interest in the progr am. 
Identif y schools for the pilot and prepare staff for launch. 
Identif y and support k ey school staff to communicate with STLS families and students
and share information about the cash tr ansfer progr am and when the progr am
application will open.
Phase II: January 2025 – Ma y 2025 
Recruit families through an online application process.
School staff will distribute the application link or QR code via email, paper fly ers, and
other methods.
IEL will explore direct outreach path ways to families using data acquired through
the SOW (contact information for families) 
Within the application, families can consent to participate in the progr am and thevarious research activities, including the optional research surv eys.
Verify applicant eligibilit y by confirming that the applicant has a child with McKinney -
Vento status and that a family member is enrolled in IDHS benefits. 
Consenting participants will complete an optional baseline surv ey.  
Payments will be disbursed to families in both the full treatment and light treatment
groups. 
Phase III: June 2025 – December 2030 
Administer follow -up surv eys to consenting participants. 
Consenting participants will complete optional surv eys at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months
after enrollment. 
Families participating in the optional surv eys will be compensated $50 for each surv ey
completed. 
Conduct analysis to study short - and long-term progr am impact using surv eys and
administr ative data 
Note: all communications with families will be tr anslated into Spanish. This includes
outreach materials, the application, and surv eys to ensure broader accessibilit y.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Through this study , we aim to address the following research questions: 
Does a one-time substantial cash tr ansfer affect the short - and long-term housing
stabilit y of families experiencing homelessness, including those living in doubled-up
situations? 
Does a one-time cash tr ansfer affect the educational outcomes of students
experiencing homelessness? 
How does a one-time cash tr ansfer affect a family's well-being, including ph ysical and
mental health, financial stabilit y, sense of well-being, emplo yment status, access to
public benefits, and in volvement with the criminal legal system?","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is
the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body
of extant knowledge?
Appro ximately one in twent y students in Chicago Public Schools (CPS) experiences
homelessness annually (Hallberg et al. , 2021). These students face numerous challenges
in both their academic and personal liv es, which hinder their abilit y to reach their full
potential. F or instance, children from families experiencing homelessness often face sev ere
educational hurdles, including low academic performance and high absenteeism r ates
(Bahar av et al. , 2017). 
In response to the challenges posed b y homelessness, researchers and policymak ers ha ve
explored a r ange of solutions. Housing v ouchers and targeted housing subsidies ha ve been
the focus of much past research, with some evidence suggesting that these approaches
can enhance housing stabilit y by reducing instances of doubled-up households and
crowding (Pilkauskas & Michelmore, 2019) and impro ving the affordabilit y of rent and
mortgage pa yments (Pilkauskas, Michelmore, & K ovsvki, 2023). Additionally , some studies
indicate that financial and housing support ma y positiv ely impact test performance and
school attendance (Sch wartz et al. , 2019). Howev er, the o verall effect on educational
outcomes remains uncertain.  
Given the widespread and concerning nature of family homelessness and its detrimental
effects on children and families, there is a growing interest in exploring inno vative
solutions bey ond tr aditional housing subsidies. In this context, cash tr ansfers are
emerging as a promising str ategy to eliminate barriers to housing stabilit y and enhance
the well-being of families experiencing homelessness, potentially leading to impro ved
educational outcomes. R esearch on one-time cash tr ansfers has rev ealed v arying but
gener ally encour aging effects on housing stabilit y. Notably , substantial cash tr ansfers—
those ex ceeding $5,000—ha ve been link ed to reduced r ates of homelessness in pilot
progr ams such as the New Leaf Project in Canada (Dwy er et al. , 2023). 
While cash assistance has the potential to enhance family well-being and increase access
to socio-economic opportunities for unstably housed students—especially if adopted as
formal policy —the evidence supporting this potential remains mix ed. Giv en the existing
gaps in the liter ature, this research project aims to pro vide further insights into effectiv e
interv entions for family homelessness. The study will assess the effectiv eness of a large,
one-time unconditional cash tr ansfer in impro ving housing stabilit y and academic
outcomes and will explore how these funds impact family well-being.

Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated with
this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will be
asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
It is important to distinguish between progr ammatic activities and research activities for
the pilot progr am. The progr ammatic activities (Phase I) in volve working with Student
Support and Engagement (OS SE) and CPS schools, with principal appro val, to inform
families about the cash tr ansfer pilot progr am funded and offered b y IDHS . The research
activities (Phases II and III) for which IEL is seeking RRB appro val are focused on
evaluating the progr am. Specifically , we are seeking RRB appro val for the primary
research activities that in volves an optional surv ey for families. As stated earlier , an SOW
is underw ay to appro ve of all administr ative data research activities for this pilot.   
In order to implement this pilot, Giv e Directly (GD) is acting as progr am administr ator,
offering support services to k ey school personnel to inform STLS families of the cash
assistance progr am. In their role as progr am administr ator, GD has led Phase I b y
reaching out to school principals to gauge interest and to begin sharing information about
the progr am via tr ainings to adv ocates and other staff from interested schools. During
these tr ainings, adv ocates ha ve been informed that they can begin informing families
about the progr am in mid-December , providing them with an early heads-up that the
progr am will launch in January . CPS staff confirmed that RRB appro val was not required for
the progr am implementation activities of Phase I. Once SOW appro val is acquired, we
hope to send information to families about the progr am application opening in January .  
Phase II and III are the activities for which IEL is submitting an RRB . 
In Phase II, GD will collabor ate with STLS adv ocates, liaisons, and principals at the
identified schools to inform parents/guardians about the pilot progr am and encour age
them to apply . Recruitment will be conducted via emails from principals, paper fly ers, and
other methods. Once families decide to apply , an adult parent or guardian will complete
the application independently online. Applicants will ha ve the opportunit y to consent to
participate in optional research surv eys. Consenting parents/guardians will complete a
baseline surv ey and receiv e a $50 incentiv e upon completion. Additionally , during this
phase, IEL will conduct a lottery and then pa yments will be disbursed to families in both
the full treatment and light treatment groups.  
In Phase III, IEL will administer follow -up surv eys to consenting parents/guardians.
Participants will ha ve the option to complete research surv eys at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24
months after enrollment, with each completed surv ey being compensated at $50. W e will
only administer the surv eys to parents/guardians, not to students. W e will then analyz e
the surv ey data to study how the cash tr ansfers impact participants' living arr angements,
housing situations, and other self -reported measures of well-being.   
In Phase III, IEL will also conduct secondary data analysis to ev aluate the impact of the
cash tr ansfer progr am on v arious aspects of participants' liv es. This analysis will utiliz e
CPS administr ative data to understand how receiving a cash tr ansfer influences
educational outcomes for students in the households receiving cash. Appro val for this work
has been requested through a separ ate SOW under an existing master research services
agreement between IEL and CPS , not through this RRB . Additionally , the research team
will use administr ative data from v arious Continua of Care and go vernment agencies to
assess the progr am's effects on housing stabilit y, emplo yment outcomes, and o verall
family well-being.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical techniques
that will be utilized as part of this study.
To verify eligibilit y for the pilot progr am, IEL will link information pro vided b y progr am
applicants to demogr aphic and STLS files in CPS administr ative records b y conducting a
fuzzy match. W e will use data such as student name, gender , date of birth, and school
enrolled. This approach will help us determine whether students applying to the pilot meet
the eligibilit y criteria of being enrolled in STLS . 
Outcomes data will be ev aluated using a r andomiz ed control trial (RCT) fr amework. W e will
compare academic and mobilit y outcomes between the “treated” group (students from
families who receiv e the cash tr ansfer) and compar able “light treatment ” and “control”
groups (students from families who do not receiv e the cash tr ansfer). T o estimate the
progr am's impact, IEL will conduct regression analyses to quantif y differences in outcomes
between the groups. 
In addressing potential missing data, the research team ma y use techniques such as
Multiple Imputation b y Chained Equations (MICE) to ensure robust results. Additionally , we
will tr ansparently report an y missing data in all dissemination materials to maintain the
integrit y of our findings. By emplo ying these techniques, IEL aims to rigorously assess the
effects of the cash tr ansfer on the housing, academic and well-being outcomes of families
and students experiencing homelessness."

Only CPS teachers and CAPE teaching artists are participants in the
research. Though students ma y be present during observ ations, they are not
participants in the research. A parental courtesy letter (included with this
application) appro ved by the UC -Irvine IRB will be sent home with students,
notifying parents/guardians of the purpose of the study if classrooms are to
be observ ed.
This study will place a minimal burden on teachers. P articipant recruitment
will not be burdensome, as all teacher participants already participate in
CAPE’ s after school and professional dev elopment progr amming. T eachers
will be consented remotely prior to participation in the study . There is no
required technical tr aining for teacher participants because researchers will
only use Google Meets for teacher interviews.
The total time requested of CPS teacher participants aside from observ ations
of the classes they are already teaching is 1 hour . We also intend to observ e
in classes on Google Meets 2-3 times for no more than 2 hours each.
Research activities will include semi-structured interviews with teachers via
Google Meets/Z oom outside of school hours. Semi-structured interview

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The aim of this study is to understand more about how the arts can support
teachers designing for distance learning in the midst of the current
pandemic. The study focuses on a R esearch-Pr actice P artnership with UC -
Irvine researchers and the arts education non-profit, Chicago Arts
Partnerships in Education (CAPE). W e are interested in exploring the
variation across teacher and teaching artist teams in their after school
progr am in relation to a few k ey factors: (1) how they design for “openness”
(Eco, 1989) and create inquiry -based curriculum; (2) how they engage the
communit y; and (3) how they construct space (Massey , 2005) in after school
classrooms. R esearch procedures include observing teaching teams in online
professional dev elopment sessions and classes, conducting semi-structured
interviews with teachers, and analyzing teachers' publicly a vailable online
curriculum.
In this unprecedented moment of pandemic and online learning, this
research will inform our school leadership team and support CPS District
initiativ es and str ategies including: dev eloping curriculum that is inclusiv e,
reflecting the rich cultur al div ersity of our students, combining rigor and
support with str ategies for addressing div erse learning needs, including
those of English learners and students with disabilities; expanding
opportunities for civic learning; and expanding after school and summer
progr ams.
The study will contribute to the impro vement of teachers' abilit y to use
learnings from the arts to na vigate online teaching for students who are
from low -income homes, ha ve IEP’ s, and/or who are English language
learners. 
At the conclusion of the study we will produce: (a) theoretical knowledge
resulting in design guidelines for how to support teaching teams; (b)
practical evidence regarding the tools, materials, and curriculum structures
that can support teaching teams in designing for all students; (c) evidence
on how the teaching instructional model impacts targeted outcomes; and (d)
recommendations for future professional dev elopment to support teaching
teams.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
We build from work on spatial engagement, including creating and
reconstructing space to foster psy chological safet y and share intellectual and
creativit y responsibilit y (Preston, 2019), to understand how teachers design
space to support the dev elopment of student learning and v oice tow ard
artistic, civic, and social outcomes within an online space. Giv en a
professional dev elopment focus on fostering student inquiry and communit y
engagement, we are interested in exploring the following research
questions: 
1. How might we better understand the qualit y, depth, and self -awareness of
teachers and teaching artist teams in relation to: (a) the creation of an open
and explor atory inquiry -based curriculum? (b) engagement of school and
neighborhood communities in the inquiry process? (c) the social
(re)construction of space within classrooms and/or online spaces?
2. What kinds of tools and materials, task and participant structures, and
discursiv e practices support teachers and teaching artist teams to engender
openness?","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this

research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The aim of this study is to understand more about how the arts can support
teachers designing for distance learning in the midst of and aftermath of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
A persistent issue in educational research is that results are often distant
from ev eryday issues of pr actice (The Design-Based R esearch Collectiv e,
2003). Howev er, there is a v ast and promising base of research in the
learning sciences that aims to directly address problems of pr actice to
produce “usable knowledge” (Langemann, 2002) through an iter ative design
and dev elopment process. This research base and set of approaches––called
Design-Based R esearch (DBR) (Brown; 1992; Collins, 1992; Edelson, 2002)
or informally , design research–– aims to mak e both pr actical and theoretical
contributions through the systematic design and study of learning spaces. A
primary aim of design research is to impro ve educational pr actice through
the dev elopment of theory about domain-specific learning and other relev ant
phenomena. 
Design research is especially applicable to an arts education context and
flexible, non-stagnant cultures where relev ant problems are not simplistic ––
design research explicitly supports systematic study of these complexities in
both formal and informal learning spaces (Cobb , Confrey , diSessa, Lehrer ,
and Schauble, 2003). Put simply , design research helps researchers
understand the “messiness” of learning en vironments and related
phenomena (Bar ab & Squire, 2004). Additionally , a focus on design and
(re)constructing learning spaces and experiences opens new possibilities for
learning that aligns with a view of education for tr ansformativ e ends
(Gutiérrez & Jurow , 2016; Gutiérrez & V ossoughi, 2010). W e aim to use
design research in a no vel way to understand how teaching teams are
supporting inquiry , engaging the communit y, and constructing space in their
classrooms so that we can better theoriz e for arts teaching and learning,
develop pr actical tools to support arts teaching and learning, and create
better professional dev elopment to support arts teachers. There is a need
for more research on teaching and learning in the arts, especially in the field
of the learning sciences, the primary field of study for the UC -Irvine
researchers in volved in the present study .","to Date
Research activities ha ve included semi-structured interviews with teachers

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The aim of this study is to understand more about how the arts can support
teachers designing for distance learning in the midst of the current
pandemic. The study focuses on a R esearch-Pr actice P artnership with UC -
Irvine researchers and the arts education non-profit, Chicago Arts
Partnerships in Education (CAPE). W e are interested in exploring the
variation across teacher and teaching artist teams in their after school
progr am in relation to a few k ey factors: (1) how they design for “openness”
(Eco, 1989) and create inquiry -based curriculum; (2) how they engage the
communit y; and (3) how they construct space (Massey , 2005) in after school
classrooms. R esearch procedures include observing teaching teams in online
professional dev elopment sessions and classes, conducting semi-structured
interviews with teachers, and analyzing teachers' publicly a vailable online
curriculum.
In this unprecedented moment of pandemic and online learning, this
research will inform our school leadership team and support CPS District
initiativ es and str ategies including: dev eloping curriculum that is inclusiv e,
reflecting the rich cultur al div ersity of our students, combining rigor and
support with str ategies for addressing div erse learning needs, including
those of English learners and students with disabilities; expanding
opportunities for civic learning; and expanding after school and summer
progr ams.
The study will contribute to the impro vement of teachers' abilit y to use
learnings from the arts to na vigate online teaching for students who are
from low -income homes, ha ve IEP’ s, and/or who are English language
learners. 
At the conclusion of the study we will produce: (a) theoretical knowledge
resulting in design guidelines for how to support teaching teams; (b)
practical evidence regarding the tools, materials, and curriculum structures
that can support teaching teams in designing for all students; (c) evidence
on how the teaching instructional model impacts targeted outcomes; and (d)
recommendations for future professional dev elopment to support teaching
teams. Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
We build from work on spatial engagement, including creating and
reconstructing space to foster psy chological safet y and share intellectual and
creativit y responsibilit y (Preston, 2019), to understand how teachers design
space to support the dev elopment of student learning and v oice tow ard
artistic, civic, and social outcomes within an online space. Giv en a
professional dev elopment focus on fostering student inquiry and communit y
engagement, we are interested in exploring the following research
questions: 
1. How might we better understand the qualit y, depth, and self -awareness of
teachers and teaching artist teams in relation to: (a) the creation of an open
and explor atory inquiry -based curriculum? (b) engagement of school and
neighborhood communities in the inquiry process? (c) the social
(re)construction of space within classrooms and/or online spaces?
2. What kinds of tools and materials, task and participant structures, and
discursiv e practices support teachers and teaching artist teams to engender
openness?Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The aim of this study is to understand more about how the arts can support
teachers designing for distance learning in the midst of and aftermath of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
A persistent issue in educational research is that results are often distant
from ev eryday issues of pr actice (The Design-Based R esearch Collectiv e,
2003). Howev er, there is a v ast and promising base of research in the
learning sciences that aims to directly address problems of pr actice to
produce “usable knowledge” (Langemann, 2002) through an iter ative design
and dev elopment process. This research base and set of approaches––called
Design-Based R esearch (DBR) (Brown; 1992; Collins, 1992; Edelson, 2002)
or informally , design research–– aims to mak e both pr actical and theoretical
contributions through the systematic design and study of learning spaces. A
primary aim of design research is to impro ve educational pr actice through
the dev elopment of theory about domain-specific learning and other relev ant
phenomena. 
Design research is especially applicable to an arts education context and
flexible, non-stagnant cultures where relev ant problems are not simplistic ––
design research explicitly supports systematic study of these complexities in
both formal and informal learning spaces (Cobb , Confrey , diSessa, Lehrer ,
and Schauble, 2003). Put simply , design research helps researchers
understand the “messiness” of learning en vironments and related
phenomena (Bar ab & Squire, 2004). Additionally , a focus on design and
(re)constructing learning spaces and experiences opens new possibilities for
learning that aligns with a view of education for tr ansformativ e ends
(Gutiérrez & Jurow , 2016; Gutiérrez & V ossoughi, 2010). W e aim to use
design research in a no vel way to understand how teaching teams are
supporting inquiry , engaging the communit y, and constructing space in their
classrooms so that we can better theoriz e for arts teaching and learning,
develop pr actical tools to support arts teaching and learning, and create
better professional dev elopment to support arts teachers. There is a need
for more research on teaching and learning in the arts, especially in the field
of the learning sciences, the primary field of study for the UC -Irvine
researchers in volved in the present study . Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement

School UPK administr ators, students' parents, and preschool teachers will be ask ed to
take part in 30-60 minute semi-structured interviews virtually on Z oom with North western
trained researchers (undergr aduate, gr aduate, and PI team members). All tr ained
researchers will participate in a 2-3 hour session to review best pr actices for interviewing
and establish norms of recruitment and interviewing. All interviews will begin with a short
survey of demogr aphic char acteristics and progr am information using Qualtrics. T rained
interviewers will use semi-structured interview guides to understand administr ators'
perceptions about the opportunities and challenges of the Chicago UPK expansion on
access/progr am offering, teacher recruitment and retention, school/center qualit y, and

Fall 2023/Winter 2024. In the spring/summer 2024, we will analyz e and disseminate our
results.","Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the motivation,
design, and implications of the project.
Our proposed qualitativ e study seeks to examine early childhood education
administr ators' perceptions of the challenges and opportunities during the Chicago
Universal PreK (UPK) rollout in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. W e will conduct 30-
60 minute interviews with school UPK administr ators in the most disadv antaged
communities to understand their perceptions related to four k ey themes: (i)
access/progr am offering; (ii) teacher recruitment and retention; (iii) school/center
qualit y; and (iv) administr ation. Specifically , we will examine in the context of the COVID-
19 pandemic: (a) to what extent has the Chicago UPK expansion affected the schools'
capacit y, enrollment, and progr am offering in early childhood; (b) how parents find and
choose early childhood education progr ams; (c) the effects of UPK on schools' abilit y to
recruit and retain teachers; (d) how has UPK affected the classroom instruction,
curriculum, professional dev elopment, and family and social support services; (e)
connections between the early childhood education (ECE) progr amming with the K -8
progr amming and kindergarten tr ansition services; and (f ) experiences of the streamlined
process when dealing with administr ative tasks (e.g. , budgeting, compliance). Data
collection is planned to tak e place in Spring 2022.
Parent Interview Sub-study .The proposed parent -interview sub-study seeks to examine
parents’ experience of and participation in the new Chicago Univ ersal PreK (UPK) system
with the explicit goal of bringing parent v oices to the progr am assessment. W e will
conduct 30-60 minute interviews with parents who are making important decisions for
their preschool aged children to learn from them about their experiences, challenges, and
opportunities na vigating school-based UPK. Data collection for this portion of the study is
slated for Spring/Summer 2023
Teacher Interview Sub-study: The proposed teacher -interview sub-study seeks to
examine early educators’ experience of and participation in Chicago’ s Univ ersal pre-
kindergarten progr am. W e will conduct 30-60-minute interviews with preschool teachers
about the experiences, challenges, and opportunities of implementing univ ersal pre-
kindergarten. Data collection for this portion of the study is slated for the Summer of
2023.
This qualitativ e study is a part of a larger study on the impacts of Chicago UPK on access,
qualit y, child care mark et, and child outcomes. The full Chicago UPK study will also dr aw
from existing administr ative and census data and qualitativ e data from administr ators in
communit y-based organizations.
Overall, the Chicago UPK initiativ e has the potential to tr ansform early childhood
education in Chicago . A careful study has the potential not only to pro vide timely ,
formativ e feedback to the cit y, but also to pro vide rigorous evidence on best pr actices and
impacts—making Chicago a national model that will inform other cities as they follow
Chicago’ s lead and expand their own preschool progr am.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The research questions that guide the proposed qualitativ e study are as follows: (1) T o
what extent has the Chicago UPK expansion affected the access, teacher recruitment and
retention, school/center qualit y, and administr ative process in the midst of the COVID-19
pandemic? (2) What are the challenges and opportunities to offering UPK in school-based
settings?
We hypothesiz e that the implementation of Chicago UPK in the most disadv antaged
communities will lead to increased access to full-da y preschool for 4- year-old children in
these communities. Schools will ha ve more full-da y slots a vailable for 4- year-old children
and enroll more of these children as well. W e also h ypothesiz e that UPK will impro ve
schools' abilit y to hire and retain teachers because of the higher salary in the public
school system. The high-qualit y standards set b y the UPK could also impro ve the progr am
qualit y through classroom instruction, evidence-based curriculum, and professional
development opportunities. In addition, the streamlined enrollment process ma y reduce
the administr ative load of administr ators and enable them to in vest more time in teacher
and family support.
We are modif ying and adding parents: W e hypothesiz e that parents will ha ve diverse
experiences participating in school-based progr ams based on v arious demogr aphic
characteristics and personal perspectiv es. Some parents ma y feel a greater connection to
early care en vironments and more opportunities for the dev elopment of their children,
while others ma y have been comfortable with the tr aditional system and ma y be ha ving
difficult y navigating this new one. Some parents ma y not notice an y changes at all to
their experience and participation.
We are modif ying and adding preschool teachers. W e hypothesiz e that teachers will ha ve
diverse experiences implementing UPK based on v arious demogr aphic char acteristics,
personal perspectiv es, and progr am locations. Some teachers ma y not notice an y changes
to their classroom demogr aphics or enrollment while others ma y report impacts to their
day to da y classroom experiences, their students' demogr aphics, and the o verall networks
of support to tr ansition students into kindergarten. 
Howev er, as the Chicago UPK progr am has rolled-out, two additional shocks to the child
care system ha ve occurred: the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in the minimum
wage in Chicago . Our research questions are therefore all open questions giv en the
compounded effects of the pandemic and the minimum w age increase. W e will
descriptiv ely explore these questions through semi-structured interviews with school UPK
administr ators in the most disadv antaged communities.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is
the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body
of extant knowledge?
The purpose of the full Chicago UPK study on school-based UPK progr ams is to examine
the impact of the roll-out of Chicago’ s UPK across three broad areas: access, qualit y, and
outcomes.
Access. A hallmark of Chicago’ s UPK expansion is the stated commitment to reach all
eligible children within the cit y, with an intentional goal of ensuring that UPK first serv es
the neediest communities in order to address opportunit y gaps and reduce the barriers to
access through streamlined enrollment. This is an ambitious goal and historically , there
are large disparities in access to ECE in the U .S., where low - and middle-income children
participate in ECE at lower r ates compared to their higher -income peers (e.g. , 40% v ersus
70%; National Academ y of Sciences, 2018).   In order to address this issue, Chicago’ s
UPK model plans to increase the number of preschool slots b y offering enough publicly
funded slots to serv e 95% of eligible 4- year-old children while pro viding a streamlined
enrollment process. W e will explore the extent to which UPK leads to increased access and
enrollment in publicly funded preschool prior to kindergarten entry . We will also explore
whether we observ e substantial increases in enrollment in publicly funded preK among
low-income children, with the hope of better understanding if Chicago UPK serv es children
from the most vulner able backgrounds. If indeed Chicago meets the goal of increasing
access to preschool for low -income children, it will lik ely serv e as a model for other cities
that seek to impro ve access to early childhood education and address education
inequities.
Qualit y. Beyond access, there is the growing recognition that children need to experience
high qualit y early care and education to maximiz e the impact of early in vestment on child
development (Barnett, 2011; Puma et al. , 2010; Y oshika wa et al. , 2013). Indeed, a broad
range of the effectiv eness of preK progr ams is due in large part to children’ s varying
experiences within those progr ams, resulting in unev en benefits to children. Moreo ver, in
more contempor ary ev aluations of scaled-up ECE progr ams, positiv e initial short -term
benefits diminish as children progress through elementary school (Bailey et al. , 2017). As
a result, the promise of ECE to tr ansform educational outcomes and promote equit y may
only be realiz ed when (i) children from div erse socioeconomic backgrounds ha ve access to
high qualit y ECE; and (ii) ECE and elementary school systems are designed to support
and sustain learning throughout early childhood.  The Chicago model is intended to
provide services to all students in an area, which will be expected to change the
classroom experiences for teachers and students going forw ard. Y et, it is an open
question if kindergarten teachers indeed change their pr actices as a result of UPK. That is,
as the majorit y of children arriv e to kindergarten more prepared for school, it is unclear
whether teachers modif y their pr actices to pro vide more adv anced content. Anticipating
this issue, Chicago UPK is offering professional dev elopment for both UPK and
kindergarten teachers, but it is an empirical question about the extent to which
kindergarten teachers indeed respond to UPK expansion. F or the current study , we focus
on both structur al qualit y (i.e. , teacher education or class siz e) as well as process qualit y,
which emphasiz es the w ays in which teachers and children inter act the classroom. In
particular , the qualit y of teacher -child inter actions and the extent to which teachers
provide increasingly adv anced instruction in k ey content areas (e.g. , math and liter acy)
may be particularly important indicators of qualit y to monitor in kindergarten giv en the
UPK expansion (Bronfenbrenner , 1989; V ygotsky , 1978; Y oshika wa et al. , 2013).
Child Outcomes. The fundamental goal of preK is to ensure that children acquire the early
skills, attitudes, and knowledge that will set them on a path tow ards life success (Phillips
et al., 2017) and to reduce opportunit y gaps that exist across r acial and economic factors.
Educational readiness for kindergarten consists of a constellation of academic and
socioemotional skills needed to accrue more adv anced skills in elementary school and
beyond. As a result, it is an important to understand the extent to which Chicago’ s UPK
leads to impro vements in children’ s school readiness, including academic and social skills,
and how that compares to other UPK systems across the nation. P ast evidence has foundthat CPS students’ test scores in elementary and middle school grow at a faster r ate than
almost an y other school system in the nation. Y et, on a verage, students in CPS start out
behind in the early gr ades (R eardon, 2019). Thus, a carefully designed UPK system has
the potential to ensure that CPS students enter kindergarten ready to learn and are better
equipped to tak e adv antage of the learning opportunities in the K -12 system and promote
equitable learning outcomes for the cit y’s youngest learners.
The proposed qualitativ e study is embedded in the full Chicago UPK study , seeking to
understand issues related to access and qualit y from school UPK administr ators', parents',
and teachers' perspectiv es during the implementation of UPK in school-based settings
acknowledging the context of the pandemic and the minimum w age increase in Chicago .","to Date
We have conducted 30-60 minute interviews with multiple stak eholders in the UPK system
(CPS administr ators, preschool teachers, and parents) to understand how they mak e
meaning of the univ ersal pre-k rollout across the four domains outlined in the quantitativ e
research questions: 1) access, 2) mark et, 3) qualit y, and 4) child outcomes. W e have
developed interview protocols, recruitment materials, the demogr aphic surv ey, and
obtained North western IRB appro val. We have assembled a team of 3 gr aduate students,
3 research coordinators and 4 undergr aduate research assistants to assist with data
collection, cleaning, and coding.
Our progress to date is as follows:
CPS Principals: Initial goal to recruit 15 principals for interviews, concluded data collection
after 10 interviews.
CPS P arents: Initial goal to recruit 30 parents with children enrolled in UPK -eligible CPS
preschools, concluded data collection after 22 interviews (14 in English, 8 in Spanish).
CPS T eachers: Initial goal to recruit 15 preschool teachers for interviews, concluded data
collection after 16 interviews.
Preliminary Results to Date
We are currently in the data cleaning, coding, or analysis stage for teachers. Data
cleaning and tr anscription is done b y individual reviews following a natur al approach,
coding is done in the qualitativ e data analysis application Dedoose, and analysis is done in
teams focused on the specific RQ . We hope to ha ve preliminary findings ready to share in
2024-25 school y ear.

Interviews
QuestionnairePlease outline your protocol for individual interview activities, describing when,
where, duration, frequency, and with whom.
School UPK administr ators, students' parents, and preschool teachers will be ask ed to
take part in 30-60 minute semi-structured interviews virtually on Z oom with North western
trained researchers (undergr aduate, gr aduate, and PI team members). All tr ained
researchers will participate in a 2-3 hour session to review best pr actices for interviewing
and establish norms of recruitment and interviewing. All interviews will begin with a short
survey of demogr aphic char acteristics and progr am information using Qualtrics. T rained
interviewers will use semi-structured interview guides to understand administr ators'
perceptions about the opportunities and challenges of the Chicago UPK expansion on
access/progr am offering, teacher recruitment and retention, school/center qualit y, and
administr ation.
We began data collection with administr ators and parents. W e hope to complete that b y
end of summer ,early fall 2023. Our hope is to complete data collection with teachers b y
Fall 2023/Winter 2024. In the spring/summer 2024, we will analyz e and disseminate our
results.
Does this involve video, audio, or photograph recording?
Yes
Please describe the protocol for audio/video recording
Recording: T rained researchers will conduct the interviews in a priv ate Zoom room. T rained
researchers will tak e observ ational notes and con versations will be digitally audio recorded
and tr anscribed. Consent to being audio recorded is required for participation in the study .
Subjects will also ha ve the option to agree to allow the audio to be used in presentation,
which is not mandatory for participation. The use of audio footage in presentations helps
to giv e voice to our participants, pro viding opportunit y for members of the
research/policy/pr actitioner audience to hear the affect and tone of participants. W e have
found that using audio recordings in previous work ha ve been the single best w ay to allow
our subjects to speak for themselv es and allowing them to ha ve a “v oice at the table” so
to speak while minimizing the risk to the participants in terms of making the data
identifiable (v ersus video). Because this is a qualitativ e study , quotes are data and thus
using participants’ actual v oices r ather than ha ving the researcher read the quotes is much
more effectiv e-- and most importantly accur ate-- w ay of presenting results. W e will not
record videos on Z oom.

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the motivation,
design, and implications of the project.
Our proposed qualitativ e study seeks to examine early childhood education
administr ators' perceptions of the challenges and opportunities during the Chicago
Universal PreK (UPK) rollout in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. W e will conduct 30-
60 minute interviews with school UPK administr ators in the most disadv antaged
communities to understand their perceptions related to four k ey themes: (i)
access/progr am offering; (ii) teacher recruitment and retention; (iii) school/center
qualit y; and (iv) administr ation. Specifically , we will examine in the context of the COVID-
19 pandemic: (a) to what extent has the Chicago UPK expansion affected the schools'
capacit y, enrollment, and progr am offering in early childhood; (b) how parents find and
choose early childhood education progr ams; (c) the effects of UPK on schools' abilit y to
recruit and retain teachers; (d) how has UPK affected the classroom instruction,
curriculum, professional dev elopment, and family and social support services; (e)
connections between the early childhood education (ECE) progr amming with the K -8
progr amming and kindergarten tr ansition services; and (f ) experiences of the streamlined
process when dealing with administr ative tasks (e.g. , budgeting, compliance). Data
collection is planned to tak e place in Spring 2022.
Parent Interview Sub-study .The proposed parent -interview sub-study seeks to examine
parents’ experience of and participation in the new Chicago Univ ersal PreK (UPK) system
with the explicit goal of bringing parent v oices to the progr am assessment. W e will
conduct 30-60 minute interviews with parents who are making important decisions for
their preschool aged children to learn from them about their experiences, challenges, and
opportunities na vigating school-based UPK. Data collection for this portion of the study is
slated for Spring/Summer 2023
Teacher Interview Sub-study: The proposed teacher -interview sub-study seeks to
examine early educators’ experience of and participation in Chicago’ s Univ ersal pre-
kindergarten progr am. W e will conduct 30-60-minute interviews with preschool teachers
about the experiences, challenges, and opportunities of implementing univ ersal pre-
kindergarten. Data collection for this portion of the study is slated for the Summer of
2023.
This qualitativ e study is a part of a larger study on the impacts of Chicago UPK on access,
qualit y, child care mark et, and child outcomes. The full Chicago UPK study will also dr aw
from existing administr ative and census data and qualitativ e data from administr ators in
communit y-based organizations.
Overall, the Chicago UPK initiativ e has the potential to tr ansform early childhood
education in Chicago . A careful study has the potential not only to pro vide timely ,
formativ e feedback to the cit y, but also to pro vide rigorous evidence on best pr actices and
impacts—making Chicago a national model that will inform other cities as they follow
Chicago’ s lead and expand their own preschool progr am.Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The research questions that guide the proposed qualitativ e study are as follows: (1) T o
what extent has the Chicago UPK expansion affected the access, teacher recruitment and
retention, school/center qualit y, and administr ative process in the midst of the COVID-19
pandemic? (2) What are the challenges and opportunities to offering UPK in school-based
settings?
We hypothesiz e that the implementation of Chicago UPK in the most disadv antaged
communities will lead to increased access to full-da y preschool for 4- year-old children in
these communities. Schools will ha ve more full-da y slots a vailable for 4- year-old children
and enroll more of these children as well. W e also h ypothesiz e that UPK will impro ve
schools' abilit y to hire and retain teachers because of the higher salary in the public
school system. The high-qualit y standards set b y the UPK could also impro ve the progr am
qualit y through classroom instruction, evidence-based curriculum, and professional
development opportunities. In addition, the streamlined enrollment process ma y reduce
the administr ative load of administr ators and enable them to in vest more time in teacher
and family support.
We are modif ying and adding parents: W e hypothesiz e that parents will ha ve diverse
experiences participating in school-based progr ams based on v arious demogr aphic
characteristics and personal perspectiv es. Some parents ma y feel a greater connection to
early care en vironments and more opportunities for the dev elopment of their children,
while others ma y have been comfortable with the tr aditional system and ma y be ha ving
difficult y navigating this new one. Some parents ma y not notice an y changes at all to
their experience and participation.
We are modif ying and adding preschool teachers. W e hypothesiz e that teachers will ha ve
diverse experiences implementing UPK based on v arious demogr aphic char acteristics,
personal perspectiv es, and progr am locations. Some teachers ma y not notice an y changes
to their classroom demogr aphics or enrollment while others ma y report impacts to their
day to da y classroom experiences, their students' demogr aphics, and the o verall networks
of support to tr ansition students into kindergarten. 
Howev er, as the Chicago UPK progr am has rolled-out, two additional shocks to the child
care system ha ve occurred: the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in the minimum
wage in Chicago . Our research questions are therefore all open questions giv en the
compounded effects of the pandemic and the minimum w age increase. W e will
descriptiv ely explore these questions through semi-structured interviews with school UPK
administr ators in the most disadv antaged communities.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is
the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body
of extant knowledge?
The purpose of the full Chicago UPK study on school-based UPK progr ams is to examine
the impact of the roll-out of Chicago’ s UPK across three broad areas: access, qualit y, and
outcomes.
Access. A hallmark of Chicago’ s UPK expansion is the stated commitment to reach all
eligible children within the cit y, with an intentional goal of ensuring that UPK first serv es
the neediest communities in order to address opportunit y gaps and reduce the barriers to
access through streamlined enrollment. This is an ambitious goal and historically , there
are large disparities in access to ECE in the U .S., where low - and middle-income children
participate in ECE at lower r ates compared to their higher -income peers (e.g. , 40% v ersus
70%; National Academ y of Sciences, 2018).   In order to address this issue, Chicago’ s
UPK model plans to increase the number of preschool slots b y offering enough publicly
funded slots to serv e 95% of eligible 4- year-old children while pro viding a streamlined
enrollment process. W e will explore the extent to which UPK leads to increased access and
enrollment in publicly funded preschool prior to kindergarten entry . We will also explore
whether we observ e substantial increases in enrollment in publicly funded preK among
low-income children, with the hope of better understanding if Chicago UPK serv es children
from the most vulner able backgrounds. If indeed Chicago meets the goal of increasing
access to preschool for low -income children, it will lik ely serv e as a model for other cities
that seek to impro ve access to early childhood education and address education
inequities.
Qualit y. Beyond access, there is the growing recognition that children need to experience
high qualit y early care and education to maximiz e the impact of early in vestment on child
development (Barnett, 2011; Puma et al. , 2010; Y oshika wa et al. , 2013). Indeed, a broad
range of the effectiv eness of preK progr ams is due in large part to children’ s varying
experiences within those progr ams, resulting in unev en benefits to children. Moreo ver, in
more contempor ary ev aluations of scaled-up ECE progr ams, positiv e initial short -term
benefits diminish as children progress through elementary school (Bailey et al. , 2017). As
a result, the promise of ECE to tr ansform educational outcomes and promote equit y may
only be realiz ed when (i) children from div erse socioeconomic backgrounds ha ve access to
high qualit y ECE; and (ii) ECE and elementary school systems are designed to support
and sustain learning throughout early childhood.  The Chicago model is intended to
provide services to all students in an area, which will be expected to change the
classroom experiences for teachers and students going forw ard. Y et, it is an open
question if kindergarten teachers indeed change their pr actices as a result of UPK. That is,
as the majorit y of children arriv e to kindergarten more prepared for school, it is unclear
whether teachers modif y their pr actices to pro vide more adv anced content. Anticipating
this issue, Chicago UPK is offering professional dev elopment for both UPK and
kindergarten teachers, but it is an empirical question about the extent to which
kindergarten teachers indeed respond to UPK expansion. F or the current study , we focus
on both structur al qualit y (i.e. , teacher education or class siz e) as well as process qualit y,
which emphasiz es the w ays in which teachers and children inter act the classroom. In
particular , the qualit y of teacher -child inter actions and the extent to which teachers
provide increasingly adv anced instruction in k ey content areas (e.g. , math and liter acy)
may be particularly important indicators of qualit y to monitor in kindergarten giv en the
UPK expansion (Bronfenbrenner , 1989; V ygotsky , 1978; Y oshika wa et al. , 2013).
Child Outcomes. The fundamental goal of preK is to ensure that children acquire the early
skills, attitudes, and knowledge that will set them on a path tow ards life success (Phillips
et al., 2017) and to reduce opportunit y gaps that exist across r acial and economic factors.
Educational readiness for kindergarten consists of a constellation of academic and
socioemotional skills needed to accrue more adv anced skills in elementary school and
beyond. As a result, it is an important to understand the extent to which Chicago’ s UPK
leads to impro vements in children’ s school readiness, including academic and social skills,
and how that compares to other UPK systems across the nation. P ast evidence has foundthat CPS students’ test scores in elementary and middle school grow at a faster r ate than
almost an y other school system in the nation. Y et, on a verage, students in CPS start out
behind in the early gr ades (R eardon, 2019). Thus, a carefully designed UPK system has
the potential to ensure that CPS students enter kindergarten ready to learn and are better
equipped to tak e adv antage of the learning opportunities in the K -12 system and promote
equitable learning outcomes for the cit y’s youngest learners.
The proposed qualitativ e study is embedded in the full Chicago UPK study , seeking to
understand issues related to access and qualit y from school UPK administr ators', parents',
and teachers' perspectiv es during the implementation of UPK in school-based settings
acknowledging the context of the pandemic and the minimum w age increase in Chicago .

Our proposed project ""T ALLY: Total ALL -important pregnant and parenting
Youth count"" builds off an established communit y-academic partnership
between the P otocsnak F amily Division of Adolescent and Y oung Adult
Medicine and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Office of Student Health and
Wellness (OSHW) (ARCC a wardee 2018; Heath y Communities a wardee
2020). Our expertise in leading this effort builds off existing success of
Adolescent and Y oung Adult Medicine’ s research and communit y initiativ e
teams. Our research efforts include an Alliance for R esearch in Chicagoland
Communities funded “Identif ying Best Pr actices to Support Pregnant and
Parenting Y oung P eople in CPS” study in collabor ation with Chicago Public
Schools. This study aimed to increase CPS capacit y by describing and
identif ying the needs of PP Y students to dev elop and implement no vel
progr ammatic str ategies using an interv ention mapping fr amework. Our
team conducted formativ e research including a liter ature review and logic
model of current PP Y challenges, a logic model of change w as created to
guide progr am design, and we conducted qualitativ e interviews with 51
participants (26 PP Y; 25 staff ). Additionally , we conducted focus groups with
7 participants (3 PP Y; 4 staff ) to preview potential progr ammatic str ategies
leveraged from the qualitativ e interviews.  
Additionally , Adolescent Medicine’ s Communit y Progr ams team utiliz ed
previous Health y Communities funding to dev elop a self -paced webinar for
CPS staff to receiv e training in best pr actices in supporting PP Y. As part of a
process ev aluation, our team conducted focus groups with 9 participants (2
PPY; 7 staff ) to ask about tr aining content reactions, modifications, and
utility which further demonstr ated the need for individualiz ed academic
support for PP Y.
Through this work, our team disco vered the need to collect quantitativ e data
to pro vide CPS with an accur ate number of pregnant and parenting students
attending Chicago Public Schools.Our goal for the proposed project is to
acceler ate piloting progr ammatic str ategies to support PP Y attending CPS
through dev elopment and implementation of a quantitativ e surv ey for CPS
school counselors, social work ers, and case managers. Our design plans to
enroll N=200 CPS staff to to participate in a one-time online surv ey through
RedCap , a secure web-based data collection platform. Upon completing data
collection, descriptiv e statistics will be used to describe the char acteristics of
staff (school, job title) as well as experience working with and tr acking
progress and needs of pregnant and parenting students. The surv ey will
provide CPS with data to gauge an accur ate count of the number of
pregnant and parenting students enrolled at CPS . Having this data will allow
CPS to dev elop str ategies on how to support PP Y.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.

The teen birth r ate in Chicago remains higher than the national a verage
(24.2per 1000) and according to the 2019 Y outh Risk Beha vior Surv ey, in
2019, 4.8%(N=5,049)of Chicago Public School (CPS) high school students
and 1.5%(N=3,030)of middle school students reported ha ving been
pregnant or gotten someone pregnant in the past 12
month1,2,3 Furthermore, teen birth r ates are disproportionately higher in
the Belmont Cr agin and A ustin neighborhoods (33.6 and 40.7 per 1000,
respectiv ely) as are teen birth r ates in sev eral communit y areas with a V ery
Low Child Opportunit y Index. While cit ywide initiativ es ha ve placed emphasis
on teen pregnancy prev ention str ategies through long- acting rev ersible
contraceptiv es and sexual health education, limited attention has been giv en
to identification, dev elopment, and implementation of best pr actices to
support CPS students who are currently pregnant and/or parenting (PP Y).
Existing supports within CPS are v aried throughout the district and are
uncoordinated with minimal streamlined processes in pro viding
comprehensiv e academic supports to pregnant and parenting students.
Limited support and lack of tailored interv entions contribute to the
challenges that PP Y are already facing, including but not limited to stigma,
low academic achiev ement, school drop-out, pre-term births, low childbirth
weight, and postpartum depression4. Addressing this gap pro vides
opportunit y for impro ved health outcomes for both pregnant and parenting
students as well as their children.

the SER conference in June 2023.
View xForm - Research Review Board (RRB) SubmissionPreliminary Results to Date
A total of 95 participants completed the surv ey representing 92 unique
schools (57% of the district). Most surv ey participants were school Social
Workers (39%) followed b y School Counselors (32%). Most participants
(94%) reported 0-5 pregnant students enrolled during the 2021-2022 school
year. 4% of participants answered that 6-10 pregnant students were
enrolled, 2% answered 11-20 pregnant students enrolled, and no one
responded that their school had more than 20 pregnant students enrolled.
When ask ed how these numbers compared to previous y ears, the majorit y
(67%) responded that this w as equal to previous y ears, 21% responded
fewer than previous y ears, and 12% responded more than previous y ears.
When ask ed about the number of parenting students enrolled during the
2021-2022 school y ear, the majorit y (83%) responded 0-5, 10% responded
6-10, 6% responded 11-20, and 1% responded more than 20.
Compared to the number of parenting students in previous y ears, the
majorit y (68%) responded equal to previous y ears, 17% responded fewer
than previous y ears, and 15% responded more than previous y ears. 39%
reported that their school does not ha ve a process for counting PP Y
students, 23% of participants answered that their school does ha ve a
system for tr acking PP Y students, and 38% were unsure about whether or
not their school had a data collection process for counting enrolled PP Y
students. When ask ed about data collection methods for tr acking PP Y
enrollment, the top responses were: 57% self -disclosure from students,
28% medical documentation, and 27% through applications for homebound
instruction. When ask ed about challenges collecting data on PP Y enrollment,
the overwhelming majorit y (67%) responded that student records do not
contain an y information about PP Y status. Additional challenges reported
included confidentialit y concerns with school records (26%), confidentialit y
concerns with medical records (20%), limited staff capacit y (17%) and other
such students requesting assistance with childcare and a student self -
disclosure form completing during orientation (22%). When ask ed about
how staff would ideally collect data on PP Y enrollment responses included
student disclosure (81%), medical documentation (59%), through
applications for homebound instruction (34%), student accommodations
(24%), student academic records (20%), support with lactation spaces
(16%) and other (6%).

Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Our proposed project ""T ALLY: Total ALL -important pregnant and parenting
Youth count"" builds off an established communit y-academic partnership
between the P otocsnak F amily Division of Adolescent and Y oung Adult
Medicine and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Office of Student Health and
Wellness (OSHW) (ARCC a wardee 2018; Heath y Communities a wardee
2020). Our expertise in leading this effort builds off existing success of
Adolescent and Y oung Adult Medicine’ s research and communit y initiativ e
teams. Our research efforts include an Alliance for R esearch in Chicagoland
Communities funded “Identif ying Best Pr actices to Support Pregnant and
Parenting Y oung P eople in CPS” study in collabor ation with Chicago Public
Schools. This study aimed to increase CPS capacit y by describing and
identif ying the needs of PP Y students to dev elop and implement no vel
progr ammatic str ategies using an interv ention mapping fr amework. Our
team conducted formativ e research including a liter ature review and logic
model of current PP Y challenges, a logic model of change w as created to
guide progr am design, and we conducted qualitativ e interviews with 51
participants (26 PP Y; 25 staff ). Additionally , we conducted focus groups with
7 participants (3 PP Y; 4 staff ) to preview potential progr ammatic str ategies
leveraged from the qualitativ e interviews.  
Additionally , Adolescent Medicine’ s Communit y Progr ams team utiliz ed
previous Health y Communities funding to dev elop a self -paced webinar for
CPS staff to receiv e training in best pr actices in supporting PP Y. As part of a
process ev aluation, our team conducted focus groups with 9 participants (2
PPY; 7 staff ) to ask about tr aining content reactions, modifications, and
utility which further demonstr ated the need for individualiz ed academic
support for PP Y.
Through this work, our team disco vered the need to collect quantitativ e data
to pro vide CPS with an accur ate number of pregnant and parenting students
attending Chicago Public Schools.Our goal for the proposed project is to
acceler ate piloting progr ammatic str ategies to support PP Y attending CPS
through dev elopment and implementation of a quantitativ e surv ey for CPS
school counselors, social work ers, and case managers. Our design plans to
enroll N=200 CPS staff to to participate in a one-time online surv ey through
RedCap , a secure web-based data collection platform. Upon completing data
collection, descriptiv e statistics will be used to describe the char acteristics of
staff (school, job title) as well as experience working with and tr acking
progress and needs of pregnant and parenting students. The surv ey will
provide CPS with data to gauge an accur ate count of the number of
pregnant and parenting students enrolled at CPS . Having this data will allow
CPS to dev elop str ategies on how to support PP Y. Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
This study will explore the methodology used to tr ack the number of PP Y
attending CPS , and aim to pro vide an accur ate count of PP Y currently
attending CPS , and assess concerns in tr acking PP Y students.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The teen birth r ate in Chicago remains higher than the national a verage
(24.2per 1000) and according to the 2019 Y outh Risk Beha vior Surv ey, in
2019, 4.8%(N=5,049)of Chicago Public School (CPS) high school students
and 1.5%(N=3,030)of middle school students reported ha ving been
pregnant or gotten someone pregnant in the past 12
month1,2,3 Furthermore, teen birth r ates are disproportionately higher in
the Belmont Cr agin and A ustin neighborhoods (33.6 and 40.7 per 1000,
respectiv ely) as are teen birth r ates in sev eral communit y areas with a V ery
Low Child Opportunit y Index. While cit ywide initiativ es ha ve placed emphasis
on teen pregnancy prev ention str ategies through long- acting rev ersible
contraceptiv es and sexual health education, limited attention has been giv en
to identification, dev elopment, and implementation of best pr actices to
support CPS students who are currently pregnant and/or parenting (PP Y).
Existing supports within CPS are v aried throughout the district and are
uncoordinated with minimal streamlined processes in pro viding
comprehensiv e academic supports to pregnant and parenting students.
Limited support and lack of tailored interv entions contribute to the
challenges that PP Y are already facing, including but not limited to stigma,
low academic achiev ement, school drop-out, pre-term births, low childbirth
weight, and postpartum depression4. Addressing this gap pro vides
opportunit y for impro ved health outcomes for both pregnant and parenting
students as well as their children.

This is a study conducted b y the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), part of
the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), within the United States Department of
Education, to collect extensiv e data on a rotating collection of high-priorit y, education-
related topics that NCES and feder al policymak ers lack timely data on. U .S. public
primary , middle, high, and combined-gr ade schools and districts will be surv eyed each
month. NCES is authoriz ed to conduct the 2023-24 SPP b y the Education Sciences
Reform Act of 2002 (ESRA 2002; 20 U .S.C. §9543).
A 2021-22 SPP w as administered in direct response to President Biden’ s Executiv e Order
14000: Supporting the R eopening and Continuing Oper ation of Schools and Early
Childhood Education Pro viders. It w as one of the nation’ s few sources of reliable data on
a wealth of information focused on schools’ learning mode offerings, virus spread
mitigation str ategies, services offered for students and staff , issues with staffing, and
technology use, as reported b y principals in U .S. public schools. Due to the success of
the 2021-22 SPP , NCES w as requested to start a new panel to collect data throughout
the 2023-24 school y ear. About 4,000 public elementary , middle, high, and combined-
grade schools will be selected to participate in the panel, where school staff will be
asked to pro vide data on a monthly basis on topics that the Department lacks
comprehensiv e or timely data on. The 2023-24 SPP collections will begin in A ugust 2023
and will continue throughout the 2023-24 school y ear through June 2024. Collecting
data on a monthly basis will fill critical knowledge gaps. By participating, information
from school(s) in y our district allows for comparisons among different t ypes of schools

The SPP collects detailed information that is critical for data-driv en decision making on
progr am and policy implementation and feder al funding distributions b y progr am offices
in the Department of Education, the White House, other feder al agencies, and Congress.
The abilit y of NCES to pro vide this important information is contingent upon the

themselv es and man y others lik e them, participation is vital for producing high-qualit y
information. By participating in this surv ey, you will ensure that information about y our
district ’s students and schools are included in those important decisions.","to Date
Data collection for the 2023-24 SPP is ongoing and will formally conclude in June 2024.
The U .S. Census Bureau has collected the SPP data on behalf of NCES . Data collection is
a self -administered, online surv ey.
The 2023-24 School Pulse P anel data collection began with recruitment in the spring of
2023, and initial data collection began in A ugust 2023. Each month, sampled schools
receiv e emails and letters notif ying them of the surv ey. These emails and letters include
the log-on information needed to complete the online questionnaire. R espondents ha ve
a two- week window to respond to the surv ey, and reminder emails are sent during the
data collection window .
View xForm - Research Review Board (RRB) SubmissionPreliminary Results to Date
Data are released a few weeks after data collection ends for that month to the National
Center for Education Statistics School Pulse P anel dashboard. Although the results
presented in the dashboard and the publicly a vailable Ex cel files (a vailable on the
dashboard) are weighted and adjusted for non-response, these experimental data
should be interpreted with caution. Experimental data ma y not meet all NCES qualit y
standards. The dashboard does not pro vide results on all surv ey questions, but the Ex cel
files pro vide the full set of findings for each month.
Results on the dashboard and associated Ex cel files are disaggregated b y the following
reporting groups:
• Region: Defined b y the U .S. Census Bureau, the reported region categories are
Northeast, Midwest, South, and W est. Information is from the 2021-22 Common Core of
Data (CCD).
• Locale: R eported as the following mutually ex clusiv e categories: cit y, suburb , town,
and rur al. Information is from the 2021-22 CCD .
• School lev el: Reported as the following mutually ex clusiv e categories: elementary ,
middle/other , and high/secondary . Information is from the 2021-22 CCD .
• School siz e: The school siz e is based on student enrollment information. R eported
categories are 0–299, 300–499, 500–999, and greater than or equal to 1,000.
Information is from the 2021-22CCD .
• Poverty: The Income-to-P overty ratio (IPR) for the neighborhood surrounding the
school location is used to distinguish schools in high- and low -poverty neighborhoods.
The IPR estimates come from NCES's EDGE School Neighborhood P overty Estimates.
The IPR is the percentage of family income that is abo ve or below the feder al poverty
threshold set for the family's siz e and structure and is calculated for the neighborhood
surrounding the school building. It r anges from 0 to 999, where lower IPR v alues
indicate a greater degree of po verty. A family with income at the po verty threshold has
an IPR v alue of 100. In the SPP data, IPR v alues of 200 or lower represent schools in
high–po verty neighborhoods; IPR v alues greater than 200 represent schools in low –
poverty neighborhoods.
• Race/ethnicit y: The school r ace/ethnicit y demogr aphics are reported as mutually
exclusiv e categories b y the percentage of students who are not Black, Hispanic, Asian,
American Indian/Alaska Nativ e, or T wo or More R aces. Information is from the 2021-22

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the
motivation, design, and implications of the project.
This is a study conducted b y the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), part of
the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), within the United States Department of
Education, to collect extensiv e data on a rotating collection of high-priorit y, education-
related topics that NCES and feder al policymak ers lack timely data on. U .S. public
primary , middle, high, and combined-gr ade schools and districts will be surv eyed each
month. NCES is authoriz ed to conduct the 2023-24 SPP b y the Education Sciences
Reform Act of 2002 (ESRA 2002; 20 U .S.C. §9543).
A 2021-22 SPP w as administered in direct response to President Biden’ s Executiv e Order
14000: Supporting the R eopening and Continuing Oper ation of Schools and Early
Childhood Education Pro viders. It w as one of the nation’ s few sources of reliable data on
a wealth of information focused on schools’ learning mode offerings, virus spread
mitigation str ategies, services offered for students and staff , issues with staffing, and
technology use, as reported b y principals in U .S. public schools. Due to the success of
the 2021-22 SPP , NCES w as requested to start a new panel to collect data throughout
the 2023-24 school y ear. About 4,000 public elementary , middle, high, and combined-
grade schools will be selected to participate in the panel, where school staff will be
asked to pro vide data on a monthly basis on topics that the Department lacks
comprehensiv e or timely data on. The 2023-24 SPP collections will begin in A ugust 2023
and will continue throughout the 2023-24 school y ear through June 2024. Collecting
data on a monthly basis will fill critical knowledge gaps. By participating, information
from school(s) in y our district allows for comparisons among different t ypes of schools
across the nation that are v aluable to go verning agencies, policy mak ers, educators, and
the gener al public.Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The School Pulse P anel is a dynamic monthly surv ey. Content areas for the 2023-24 SPP

Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is
the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the
body of extant knowledge?
The SPP collects detailed information that is critical for data-driv en decision making on
progr am and policy implementation and feder al funding distributions b y progr am offices
in the Department of Education, the White House, other feder al agencies, and Congress.
The abilit y of NCES to pro vide this important information is contingent upon the
voluntary participation of sampled schools. Because y our school(s) represent
themselv es and man y others lik e them, participation is vital for producing high-qualit y
information. By participating in this surv ey, you will ensure that information about y our
district ’s students and schools are included in those important decisions.

Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
The resulting data will pro vide aggregate estimates for public schools across the nation.
A stratified sample design w as used to select appro ximately 4,000 U .S. public schools.
An additional reserv e sample of replacement schools (1,000) w as selected to boost
response r ates if an y schools from the initial sample do not respond. The sample is
designed to pro vide national estimates of public primary , middle, and high schools,
taking into account the t ype of locale (urbanicit y) and r acial/ethnic student enrollment.
The sampling fr ame for the School Pulse P anel is deriv ed from the Common Core of
Data (CCD), the univ erse of public schools supplied annually b y state educational
agencies to NCES . Only public schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia will
be included in the sampling fr ame. A univ erse collection from the Outlying Areas (Guam,
Northern Marianas, U .S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa) will be administered as well.
Certain t ypes of schools are ex cluded, including newly closed schools, home schools,
ungraded schools, and schools with high gr ades of kindergarten or lower . Regular public
schools, charter schools, alternativ e schools, special education schools, v ocational
schools, and schools that ha ve partial or total magnet progr ams are included in the
frame. F or sample allocation purposes, str ata are defined b y instructional lev el, type of

There w as a correlation between students’ GP A and their attendance at the
after-school tutoring progr am","to Date
Currently in the process of ev aluating Progr am Year 4 of this 5 y ear project.Preliminary Results to Date
The following is a list of additional preliminary assertions that we attained
from student and parent surv eys:
Nearly 79% of students participating in progr amming for y ear three are
students that ha ve previously participated in 21st -century progr ams either in
a previous gr ant cy cle with this organization or during progr am year one or
two (or a combination of both). Efforts will be made to continue building on
this percentage and subsequent y ears.
85% of students believ e that participation in progr ams Helps them to get
better gr ades in math at school.
84% of students believ e that participation in progr ams helps them to get
better gr ades in reading at school.
92% of students lik e participating in the 21st -century communit y learning
center progr am at their school.
89% of students surv eyed sa y that 21st CCL C progr ams help them in
completing their homework on time.
88% of students believ e that participating in the 21st CCL C progr ams has
helped them to mak e new friends.
82% of students sa y that 21st CCL C progr ams ha ve helped them maintain
connections with their friends.
100% of parents surv eyed believ e that the 21st CCL C progr ams ha ve helped
their child(ren) with impro ving their beha vior in school.
96% of parents surv eyed believ e that the 21st CCL C progr ams ha ve helped
their child(ren) to impro ve both their reading and math skills, and ha ve been
academically beneficial.
93% of parents surv eyed believ e that the 21st CCL C progr ams ha ve offered
a wide v ariety of academic and enrichment activities to their child(ren).
Overall pre and post data growth demonstr ates that from beginning of
progr amming to the end of progr amming (this includes the summer) there is
a slight increase in students’ beliefs that participating in Aspir as 21st CCL C
before and after school progr amming has a positiv e impact on impro ving
classroom gr ades (78% in reading for beginning of the y ear to 84% in
reading for the end of summer progr amming).
In addition, pre and post data growth demonstr ates that from beginning of
progr amming to the end of progr amming (this includes the summer) there is
a constant in students’ beliefs that participating in Aspir as 21st CCL C before
and after school progr amming helps them to maintain friendships (82% for
beginning of the y ear to 83% for the end of summer progr amming).
In a r andomly selected sample of progr am participants, across the three
progr am sites, there w as no significant decrease in 1st Quarter reading
grades to 4th Quarter reading gr ades. In this regard it ma y be asserted that
participating in progr amming helps students to at least maintain gr ades from
the beginning of the y ear to the end of the y earType of Request

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
ASPIRA, in collabor ation with the LEA, Chicago Public Schools District #299
(CPS), and its  communit y partners– has made progress in addressing the
goals and objectiv es of  its 21st Century Communit y Learning Centers gr ant.
The purpose of the proposed research is to be able to attain the information
necessary to report detailed information on: 21st Century Communit y
Learning Centers 's goals, ev aluation methods, the degree of progr am
implementation including: recruitment, student enrollments b y sites, 
demogr aphic information on students, a verage (student) daily attendance,
family participation, progr am oper ations (progr am hours, staffing, staff
training, and progr am go vernance), progress that has been made in meeting
each of the project's objectiv es, other findings, o verall  recommendations
and action plans, along with dissemination of 21st Century Communit y
Learning  Centers’ ev aluation. In addition, the ev aluation process consists of
data collection and analysis  related to the  objectiv es that ISBE requests for
their gr ant recipients. A SPIRA hopes to be able to demonstr ate how it has
managed to attain positiv e outcomes at the 4 CPS schools implementing
21st  CCL C progr ams.Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The proposed research ev aluation plans to  address the following questions:
1) Has student achiev ement in reading,  mathematics, and science impro ved
(in alignment with academic achiev ement) as a result of participation in the
21st CCL C progr am?   2) Ha ve  students’ social/emotional learning impro ved
and as a result has student readiness for school/college increased due to
participation in the 21st CCL C progr am?  3) Ha ve parents, increased their 
ability to assist students with their learning (b y increasing communit y
partnerships and parent education classes/PD services) through participation
in the 21st CCL C progr am?  The h ypothesis of the proposed research study
is that students (and consequently , their parents) that participate in the 21st
CCLC progr am will demonstr ate significant positiv e growth in the areas
outlined within each of the research questions.  R esearch methods will
include data collection in the form of surv eys that will allow for the collection
of quantitativ e and qualitativ e data.
 
 
Modified research questions:
1) Has student achiev ement in reading,  mathematics, and science impro ved
(in alignment with academic achiev ement) as a result of participation in the
21st CCL C progr am?   
2) Ha ve students’ social/emotional learning impro ved as a result of
participation in the 21st CCL C progr am? 
3) Are students doing better in school (attendance, beha vior and academics)
as a result of participation in 21st CCL C progr amming?
4) Ha ve parents, increased their  abilit y to assist students with their learning
(by increasing communit y partnerships and parent education classes/PD
services) through participation in the 21st CCL C progr am?

participation in the 21st CCL C progr ams and services at their respectiv e
campuses.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
Validity for the project  instruments will be established in the following
manner: (1) ev aluation will be achiev ed with the  design and implementation
of the assessment instruments. (2) Special attention will be paid to 
constructing assessment instruments fully aligned with the goals and
activities of the 21st  Century Communit y Learning Centers project.  The
instruments will be in the form of end-of -the-year progr am surv eys for
students and their families.  Progr am site coordinators and progr am
instructors will be responsible for implementing the surv eys.   No more than 
one instrument would be administered at a time so that responses can be as
organic as possible.  In addition, progr am staff will encour age surv eyors to
provide the most honest and candid answers possible so that the most
accur ate data can be collected. P articipants will be selected, based on
academic need (i.e. being the lowest performing students at their school
sites) b y following criteria to select students: low -income status, low
academic  performance, plus an eagerness and commitment to attend the
after-school progr amming."

Proposed Evaluation Questions
The following ev aluation questions will guide this study:
To what extent is the blue cards progr am helping to reduce
disciplinary referr als?
How does the implementation of the blue cards system help
teachers’ maintain classroom discipline?
What impro vements can be made to the blue cards system?
These three questions were chosen because they are designed to
assess the effectiv eness of the blue cards system capture the essence

Theoretical Framework and Literature Review
 
The theoretical fr amework that this ev aluation study will be based on will
primarily be change theory (R einholz & Andrews, 2020) and Simons and
Ambinder (2005). There is a need for a fresh approach to address the
disciplinary challenges that the district is facing as a whole and there should
be a willingness b y managers in the district to try modalities that work,
instead of ignoring the disciplinary problem, something that Simons and
Ambinder (2005) refer to as change blindness. F or the purposes of this
evaluation study , a mix ed- methods approach comprising a quantitativ e data
gathering aspect and a qualitativ e one - on- one interview s (Cresswell &
Cresswell, 2018) will be adopted. The project site’ s blue cards system’ s
theoretical fr amework seems to be based on Canter ’s assertiv e classroom
management theory (Canter , 2010) that sees a teacher ha ving full authorit y
over the classroom. Canter ’s assertiv e theory is also the specialization
theory that this study is based on, which is corrobor ated b y the experiential
observ ation and experience of the progr am ev aluator (Maxwell, 2013). An
assertiv e classroom en vironment is an optimal climate for best instructions
to tak e place in pre-tertiary educational settings.
The ev aluation model used for this study will be the CIPP model: context,
input, process, and product model (Stufflebeam, 1971.). Stufflebeam, with
this model, look ed at the context of the progr am being ev aluated, the
stakeholders and other v ariables, the means of ev aluating the progr am, and
the expected outcome. Nudge theory (Stufflebeam, 2007) is similar to
Kellogg’ s Logic model but few differences. The presumed change theory used
for this study will be the nudge theory . The nudge theory (K osters &Van der
Heijden, 2015) is in common use in the social and beha vioral sciences fields
like economics, political science, and in other applicable fields, and w as
populariz ed by Thaler and Sunstein in their 2008 book Nudge.  As its name
implies, it the nudge theory of change is concerned with pro viding positiv e
reinforcements, a nudge, to individuals and groups to adv ance positiv e
behavior, and it seems that this w as the theoretical fr amework adopted for
the formulation of the blue cards system at the project site , since the Blue
cards system is designed to reinforce positiv e beha vior among students and
discour age un- altruistic conduct amongst the project site’ s students.

In the last y ear, The Learning P artnership engaged in the two primary
research activities of this RRB . At the middle school lev el, data collection
involved observ ations of 13 professional learning sessions for middle school
science, 7 interviews with district, network, and teacher leaders, and 8 focus
groups with teachers with 28 teachers. The results ha ve been accepted for
presentation at AEFP 2024 and AERA 2024. A t the high school lev el, data
collection in volved observ ations and video recordings of high school students
engaged in 2 Skyline chemistry activities that in volved computational
thinking. The results were presented to the Skyline team and science
department at CPS con versations with researchers session.
View xForm - Research Review Board (RRB) SubmissionPreliminary Results to Date
At the middle school lev el, we found that Skyline PL lev eraged man y
research-based pr actices; it w as content -focused, in volved activ e learning,
was coherent with district goals and NGS S standards, supported teachers
with the process of shifting to a new curriculum, and created space for
teachers to share ideas, resources, and challenges. In focus groups,
teachers articulated w anting more time for collabor ation with teachers from
other schools and more support with cultur ally responsiv e and equitable
instruction for the science classroom. R ecent observ ations of Co-Lab Cohort
Learning Cy cle 1 (F all 2023) suggest that professional learning communities
are a promising PL model to foster teacher collabor ation across schools,
support teachers with implementing Skyline, and build middle school
teachers’ capacities with cultur ally responsiv e and equitable science
instruction.
At the high school lev el, we found that although the chemistry activities
were focused on the scientific pr actice of modeling, the students actually
engaged in man y of the NGS S practices as they addressed the in vestigation
questions, including asking questions, designing in vestigations, gener ating
explanations, and dev eloping arguments. The students engaged in a v ariety
of problem-solving cy cles as they made predictions and tested h ypotheses.
We hypothesiz e that since these students had tak en the Exploring Computer
Science (ECS) course, they were particularly well-prepared to engage in
computational modeling inquiry . ECS lik ely helped them feel comfortable
with computational modeling. ECS also focused on problem solving with
computational tools, which also lik ely helped support student comfort with
engaging in computational inquiry .

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
To support the Skyline Curriculum initiativ e its ev aluation, we propose to
examine the relationships among participation in Skyline professional
development (PD); changes in teacher pr actice; and ultimately impro ved
student outcomes. Our subject and gr ade areas of focus will be middle
school science and high school science. Among the planned study activities
are: char acterizing the structure of Skyline PD (with research-based
categories of effectiv e PD), interview Skyline staff to understand the PD and
Skyline implementation process, and interview teachers implementing the
curriculum to document changes in teaching pr actice, and ultimately ,
document student learning outcomes.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Science RQ:
1. To what extent does the structure of Skyline professional dev elopment
align to research-based pr actices?
2. To what extent does participation in Skyline professional dev elopment
correlate with increases in NGS S-aligned instructional pr actices?
Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The goal of the Curriculum Equit y Initiativ e is to pro vide equitable access to
standards- aligned, high- qualit y and cultur ally responsiv e curriculum
materials to all CPS schools, educators, and students. In support of this
initiativ e, we will examine the relationships among participation in Skyline
professional dev elopment (PD), changes in teacher pr actice, and ultimately
impro ved student outcomes. W e will build on Desimone and Garet ’s (2015)
framework for effectiv e PD, which is (1) content -focused, (2) engages
teachers in activ e learning, (3) coherent with the school goals, teacher
knowledge, the needs of students, and local policies, (4) encour ages
collectiv e participation, and (5) occurs multiple times, o ver a sustained
period.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
RQ1: T o what extent does the structure of Skyline professional dev elopment
align to research-based pr actices?
We will examine Skyline design documents, interview Skyline designers and
facilitators, and conduct observ ations of Skyline professional dev elopment.
We will document the lev el of participation in both the formal Skyline
professional dev elopment opportunities as well as the informal professional
learning opportunities, including using attendance records from the formal
workshops. Next, we will interview and/or conduct focus groups with a
selection of teachers who are using Skyline and ha ve attended district
professional learning opportunities. Finally , we will conduct interviews with
school and district leaders responsible for designing, leading, and supporting
professional learning (e.g. , Skyline leaders, content specialists, PD
facilitators, school leaders, network ISLs). 
2. To what extent does participation in Skyline professional dev elopment
correlate with increases in NGS S-aligned instructional pr actices?
We will conduct teacher focus groups.
Primary Data Collection Elements
1. Skyline team member interviews (SY24-25, ongoing)
2. Skyline PD observ ations (SY24-25, ongoing)

1) Based on quantitativ e analysis of school-lev el factors, researchers will
sample 12 schools to serv e as case study examples of AP CSP choice.
Researchers will gather qualitativ e data through interviews with principals,
CS teachers, and guidance counselors. Snowball sampling will be used in
cases where it is determined that other school-lev el actors ha ve relev ant
information to share. Interviews will be guided b y semi-structured protocols,
and interview questions will be categoriz ed by topics identified within the
literature. Questions will primarily center around how school-lev el actors are
responding to student interest in AP CSP , constr ained b y capacit y issues, and
navigating the demands of complementary and competing policies and
institutional priorities.
To provide additional context, we will conduct interviews with district
personnel, including staff and leaders of the CS Department, the AP
Department, and each network office. Actors from relev ant departments
within the centr al office will be recruited for interviews based on their
knowledge of how the district is supporting schools under the priorit y of
increasing student participation in AP . In addition to the interview data, we
will collect and analyz e policy documents and written guidance on AP and
other district and school priorities, such as school impro vement plans and
CPS equit y guidance documents. Up to 50 participants will be interviewed
total.
(2) After implementing Exploring Connections activities, teachers will be
interviewed to describe the str ategies that they used to implement the
activities. Interviews with about 10 teachers will be conducted at the end of
the school y ear. The teachers will receiv e a $50 gift card for the interview .
The teacher interviews will tak e no longer than 60 minutes. The location of
the interviews will be arr anged at the con venience of the participants. In-
person interviews could tak e place at the school or at The Learning

(3) The CS T eam is dev eloping and refining approaches to support the
professional dev elopment of CS teachers through workshops. The research
seeks to better understand how teacher workshops are impacting teachers’
knowledge, beliefs and skills related to teaching CS . The research will
involve participating in two 30-minute interviews or one 60-minute interview
that will tak e place via Z oom. The teachers will be compensated with a $25
gift card for each 30-minute interview or with a $50 gift card for one 60-

View xForm - Research Review Board (RRB) SubmissionPreliminary Results to Date
Tony Kirakosian, a gr ad student at W ashington State U , conducted a
confirmatory factor analysis to in vestigate the construct in variance of two
key measures that CAFÉCS uses to measure success of CS implementation.
The first measure is the T ripod 7C+ in which students measure the extent to
which they perceiv e that teachers exhibit teaching beha viors along 10
dimensions: challenge, control, care, confer , captiv ate, clarif y, consolidate,
active learning, meaningful learning, and collabor ation. T ony’s research
found that the measure is equally v alid to be used as 10 separ ate constructs
or as one o verall construct. The factor loadings were equiv alent for both
approaches. In addition, T ony found that the constructs were in variant based
on race/ethnicit y and gender . In other words, the factor structure w as the
same for students of different r aces, ethnicit y, and genders. The second
measure w as expectancy , value, cost. These factors had previously been
validated b y Barron & Hulleman (2015). T ony’s research replicated the factor
structure. In addition, his research demonstr ated that the factors were
invariant b y race, ethnicit y, and gender . Tony found that captiv ate and
meaningful learning were most closely related to expectancy , value, and
cost.
Chungsoo Na, a gr ad student at Utah State U , used cognitiv e diagnostic
modeling to examine the results of ECS pretest and posttest performance
broken down b y the concepts that are addressed in Unit 1-4 of ECS .
Chungsoo found that pretest results indicate that of the four units, CPS
students demonstr ate more prior knowledge with Human-computer
Interaction than Problem-solving, web design, and introduction to
progr amming. Almost half of the students (45.6%) did not demonstr ate
minimum competence of an y of the units or only human-computer
interaction. Almost one-third (30.8%) of them had demonstr ated minimum
competence across four units before starting the ECS curriculum. There were
statistically significant differences in pretest performance participation in
special education, participation in FRL, ESL, and r ace. Ov erall, students
significantly increased their performance in Problem Solving and
Introduction to Progr amming among the four units. Black and Hispanic
students had higher r ates of pretest to posttest growth.
Lavare Henry , a recent gr aduate of William and Mary , used hier archical linear
modeling to in vestigate the sources of ECS course failure after the
enactment of the gr aduation requirement. R esearch on the failure r ate prior
to the enactment of the gr aduation requirement had shown that o verall GP A,
attendance, taking ECS as a freshmen, gender , and special education were
primary driv ers of course failure that remained consistent after the
implementation of the gr aduation requirement. F emale students who tak e
ECS as a freshman with higher lev els of attendance and GP A had lower
probabilit y of failure before and after the implementation of the gr aduation
requirement. Students who receiv ed special education services tend to ha ve
a higher probabilit y of failure. There are mix ed results on whether PD
attendance has a statistical effect of reducing the probabilit y of failure
depending on whether PD attendance is treated as a fix ed or r andom effect
in the model. The influence of r ace/ethnicit y on the probabilit y of coursefailure does change between and pre and post implementation of the policy .
Prior to the enactment of the gr aduation policy , students who identif y as
Hispanic and ELL had higher probabilit y of failing ECS ev en after controlling
for differences in GP A and attendance. After the implementation of the
graduation requirement, there w as no longer a difference in the probabilit y
of failure after accounting for prior GP A and attendance.

Taking on Science Outcomes in Chicago Public Schools [report]. Chicago , IL:
The Learning P artnership . https://doi.org/10.51420/report.2023.1
We collabor ated with Morgan P olikoff at USC and P aul Bruno at Univ ersity of
Illinois Urbana Champaign to test whether participation in CS courses
promotes higher course gr ades in non-CS science classes. The results
indicate that students who ha ve completed CS courses tend to earn higher
grades in subsequent science courses than students who ha ve not completed
CS courses. This analysis w as conducted on all science classes. This is
particularly true for the completion of ECS courses and is consistent with
these CS courses ha ving benefits for students that spill o ver into other
science courses. There is indeed suggestiv e evidence that the effects of CS
identified in question 1 are driv en by ECS course-taking. There w as not clear
evidence that these relationships are affected b y whether the science
teachers had participated in ECS teacher PD .
CT-STEM Classroom Observ ation
In spring 2023, we conducted classroom observ ations of students engaging
in computational thinking tasks in their chemistry class. Students from two
class sections engaged in a lesson about bonding b y investigating the
concepts with two computational models. A subset of student groups w as
video- and audio recorded while working with the computational models.
Students were giv en a worksheet that guided their in vestigations, which
included Instructions, steps to follow , tasks to complete, and questions to
answer . After student groups completed the worksheet, the teacher led a
class discussion. T o analyz e the video data, each video w as transcribed,
video of the groups and their computer screen were combined into one side-
by-side video , and the video , audio , and tr anscriptions were analyz ed to
characteriz e students’ engagement with the computational models.
As students engaged with the two computational simulations,they would
begin with reading the task or question on the worksheet and then would
engage with the simulation to dev elop and finaliz e their explanation, or
answer to the question. As students engaged with the simulation, they
engaged in sev eral actions to dev elop their initial explanation. These actions
included following instructions, asking questions, making predictions,
making observ ations, dev eloping data collection str ategies, and running
multiple trials to collect data. T o hone their explanations, students made
claims, made arguments, connected evidence, and connected science
concepts. These actions were used iter atively until students in the group
were satisfied with a final explanation.
The k ey implication of this work is that structured in vestigations with
computational models engage students in science pr actices that align with
NGSS Science and Engineering Pr actices. This computational model
investigation also pro vided students with the opportunities to connect
disciplinary core ideas (DCI) from NGS S, i.e., science content, with concreteexperiences. Much of chemistry is unobserv able with the nak ed ey e,
especially at the micro/atom lev el. As such, these computational models
provide much-needed concrete visualizations of phenomena that would
otherwise be impossible to see or experience. Furthermore, we h ypothesiz e
that since these students had tak en the Exploring Computer Science (ECS)
course, they were particularly well-prepared to engage in computational
modeling inquiry . ECS pro vided students with computational experiences
that lik ely helped them feel comfortable with computational modeling. ECS
also focused on problem solving with computational tools, which also lik ely
helped support student comfort with engaging in computational inquiry .

23-25). In vestigating How Computer Science T eachers and Instructional
Coaches Na vigated R emote Professional Dev elopment During COVID-19
[Paper presentation]. Association F or Education Finance & P olicy Annual
Meeting. Den ver, CO. https://doi.org/10.51420/conf .2023.1
This paper in vestigates how CPS computer science teachers and instructional
coaches na vigated remote professional dev elopment (PD) during the
pandemic. Starting summer 2020, CAFÉCS designed a series of remote PD
workshops for teachers, v arious one-on-one and small group coaching
opportunities, and a Coaching Professional Learning Communit y (PLC).
Based on our analysis of qualitativ e data, we found that the PD series
reinforced instructional str ategies and increasingly centered teacher
engagement and wellbeing. T eachers primarily v alued the relational aspects
of the PD , including collabor ation with other teachers and personaliz ed
support from the instructional coaches. Lev eraging an ecological perspectiv e,
we found that the pandemic and remote learning contexts amplified, r ather
than created, the PD challenges experienced b y teachers and coaches, while
also pro viding opportunities for inno vation with different PD and coaching
structures. Findings suggest that districts should expand and in vest in
individual and small group instructional coaching opportunities and that PD
can be designed to address teachers’ instructional and emotional needs.
Quantitativ e Analysis: CAFÉCS supported two gr aduate students at
Vanderbilt Univ ersity as part of the dissertation to conduct analyses on the
factors that predict the probabilit y of schools offering AP CSP . They
examined the probabilit y of schools offering AP CSP each y ear from SY17 to
SY21. Their analyses included 19 v ariables that the team felt ma y influence
the probabilit y of a school offering CSP . Their results showed that fiv e of the
19 variables were consistently statistically significant across the fiv e years of
data. As predicted b y the CAPE fr amework, capacit y, defined as the presence
of teachers that attended at least some AP CSP professional dev elopment or
were certified in CS , correlated with an increased probabilit y of a CPS high
school offering AP CSP . In addition, the o verall 5-year gr aduate r ate
correlated with an increased probabilit y of a CPS high school offering. On the
other hand, the results indicated that schools with increased percentages of
Black students, increased percentages of students enrolled in special
education, and the presence of a Career and T echnical Education –
Information T echnology (CTE- IT) tr ack correlated with decreased probabilit y
of a CPS high school offering AP CSP .Qualitativ e Analysis: The quantitativ e analysis w as followed b y qualitativ e
interviews with nine AP CSP teachers to better understand the contexts in
which AP CSP is being implemented. One important finding is that the
teachers indicated the decision on whether to offer CSP w as made b y their
principals. The teachers offered a r ange of reasons for wh y their school w as
offering AP CSP at their school. These reasons include to: increase AP
offerings and help students earn college credit, enhance IT and CS
progr amming, replace Exploring Computer Science (ECS) as a more rigorous
option, help students dev elop lucr ative skills for emplo yment during/after
high school, and help students gain v aluable CS skills ev en if they do not
pass the AP exam. Student recruitment str ategies for AP CSP were v aried. In
some schools, 9th gr aders were automatically scheduled into AP CSP . In
other schools, the teachers promoted enrollment through course fairs at the
school or personally in viting students to enroll. Ov erall, students are not well
informed about AP CSP as an option.

Exploring Connections to Computer Science: Interrogating the Adv ance of
Cultur ally R esponsiv e Pedagogical Efforts in Computer Science Education.
American Educational R esearch Association: Chicago , IL.
Findings from interviews with 10 teachers who participated in Exploring
Connections in SY21-22 rev ealed the w ays in which the Exploring
Connections progr am ma y enable teachers to be more cultur ally responsiv e
in their CS teaching. Affordances and constr aints were identified. One of the
most salient findings regarding CRP affordances w as the knowledge base
that teachers receiv ed from their students’ responses to the Exploring
Connections identit y surv ey. Receiving this information w as key to helping
teachers mak e CS content more relev ant to their students and, with that,
increasing the representation of students’ different identities and interests in
their CS classes. In addition, based on commonalities identified in the surv ey
data, some teachers were able to engage students in collabor ation and build
classroom communit y. There w as a concern that pro viding teachers with
explicit model lessons would tak e away from their opportunit y to adapt their
own lessons and ha ve more agency on their CRP efforts. Nev ertheless, we
found that teachers really appreciated receiving the Exploring Connections
model lessons that were ready to be implemented; they lik ed the design and
the fact that they did not need to prepare that themselv es. Furthermore,
they seemed to embr ace the information and examples, and found creativ e
ways to incorpor ate them into their teaching. As a result of guiding CS
learning with aspects of the students’ liv es that are important to them, some
teachers continued to encour age their students to dr aw on connections
across activities throughout the course, and the final projects for some units.
The teachers interview data also rev ealed areas in which teachers
experienced some challenges to fulfill expectations around cultur ally
responsiv e efforts. Implied in Exploring Connections to CS is an explor ation
of one’ s identit y, values, interests, etc. While the participants of this study
valued the opportunit y that Exploring Connections afforded to bring up
discussions around communit y, man y expressed that they did not feel
prepared to lead such con versations. Another significant finding w as that,
while the student data from the identit y surv ey was found helpful, man y
teachers struggled with the amount of data they were receiving and were
not sure “what to do with it. ”McGee, S ., Kelleigh, W ., & Blaz quez, B . (2023) Broadening P articipation in
Computer Science b y Helping Students Connect Computer Science to their
Lives [Report]. Chicago , IL: The Learning P artnership .
In this research, we explore the association between students’ connection
making and changes in their attitudes tow ards CS . To what extent do
students’ perceptions of their connections between their liv es and CS
correlate with changes in attitudes tow ards CS? W e predicted that after
controlling for students’ initial perceptions of the v alue of CS and their initial
interest in CS , students’ perceptions of their connections will correlate with
their end of course perceptions of the v alue of CS and changes in their lev el
of interest in CS . We modeled these relationships using structur al equation
modeling (SEM). The data were collected o ver SY22 and SY23 from student
surveys from a total of 13 CPS teachers who implemented the identit y
survey and EC2CS models with their students in their CS classes. F or the
data relev ant to this analysis, students were giv en a pre surv ey at the
beginning of the y ear, identit y surv eys to facilitate the creation of the
bookmark, end of activit y surv eys at the end of each EC2CS lesson, and a
post surv ey at the end of the y ear. From the 13 teachers, 1192 students
participated in at least one EC2CS lesson o ver the two y ears and filled out at
least one surv ey. Of these students, 315 answered both the question
regarding increased interest and at least one of the post -value construct
questions. After controlling for pre- value, students’ perceptions of making
connections during the EC2CS model lessons w as associated with students’
perceptions of post -value. Students’ perceptions of making connections
during the EC2CS model lessons w as not directly associated with students’
increased interest in CS , but r ather indirectly associated through changes in
post-value. The underlying progr am model for ECS is that teachers will
adapt lessons to connect CS content to students’ backgrounds and identities.
It is through seeing the meaningfulness of CS that students increase their
perceiv ed value of CS , which contributes to broadening participation. The
results of this analysis pro vide evidence that when teachers are successful at
scaffolding students to mak e connections between their liv es and the
content of the ECS course, students increase the v alue that they perceiv e in
CS and in turn increase their interest in pursuing additional CS in the future.

Exploring Hispanic Students’ Connections to Computer Science Content:
Towards a Cultur ally R esponsiv e Computer Science Learning Experience
[Presentation]. National Association of Bilingual Education: P ortland, OR.
The main research question that guides this study is: What is the perceiv ed
impact of EC2CS on Hispanic students’ engagement and interest in computer
science learning? Seeking to better understand how Hispanic students learn
CS topics, we w anted to explore the w ays in which they engage with EC2CS
activities. F or that, the analysis of the student work focused on looking for
Hispanic students’ identities and cultures (as self -reported in their identit y
surveys) that showed up in their completed EC2CS activities. In other words,
we wanted to know: What t ypes of personal connections are students
making to the CS topics of each lesson? Among the students who completed
all the EC2CS activities implemented b y their teachers, we selected those
who self -identified as Hispanic in the identit y surv ey and who had agreed toparticipate in this study . As a result, we collected Exploring Connections
student work from 83 Hispanic students. In the last step of each Exploring
Connections activit y, students are ask ed to reflect on how they connected
the lesson to their liv es. This paper analyz ed the kinds of connections that
students made in ECS Units 2 (problem solving), 3 (web design) and 4
(progr amming).
Interpreting the data within the context of each activit y was helpful to
hypothesiz e about the t ypes of connections that were more salient in each
case. In activities driv en solely b y a communit y theme, lik e unit 2 and the
problem-solving cy cle, family and communit y were among the most popular
choices in students’ connections. While the theme of communit y prev ailed
during unit 3, the most salient connections while dev eloping web design
skills slightly shifted to more individual aspects in students’ liv es, lik e
hobbies or careers. Lastly , in learning progr amming skills and the use of
conditionals within a giv en theme of culture and tr aditions, communit y and
identit y became more salient again among students’ connections, following
aspects of students’ daily liv es. In sum, the data collected and analyz ed in
this pilot study w as helpful to identif y the affordances and limitations of the
EC2CS progr am. These data were particularly helpful to assess the extent to
which EC2CS activities were addressing the goal of increasing cultur ally
responsiv e CS teaching, and to inform adaptations that will impro ve the
experiences of both teachers and students in the progr am.

Teacher are participating in the Exploring Connections to Computer Science
progr am. W e have created adaptations to lessons in Exploring Computer
Science and AP Computer Science Principles to allow students to bring their
background and interests into the lesson. W e have dev eloped 11 possible
lessons across the two courses. As teachers implement the lessons, they
share student work with The Learning P artnership . The lessons can be
implemented in digital format in Google Classroom or in paper format.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
For the paper v ersions, a researcher from The Learning P artnership visits the
school to collect the paper copies of the lesson. The paper copies are
scanned into The Learning P artnership's secure Dropbo x folder for this
project. F or the digital copies, the teacher shares a link to the Google
Classroom folder for the assignment. A researcher downloads a cop y of the
assignment to Dropbo x. Only researchers on the IRB protocol ha ve access to
the folder . Once downloaded to Dropbo x, the student work is de-identified
using a Learning P artnership gener ated ID number . Since informed consent
documentation process remains open throughout the y ear, at the end of the
year, all student work where we do not ha ve consent is deleted.
Please attach all relevant documents here. 
Sample Lesson from Exploring Connections Classroom ArtifactsPlease outline your protocol for individual interview activities,
describing when, where, duration, frequency, and with whom.
1) Based on quantitativ e analysis of school-lev el factors, researchers will
sample 12 schools to serv e as case study examples of AP CSP choice.
Researchers will gather qualitativ e data through interviews with principals,
CS teachers, and guidance counselors. Snowball sampling will be used in
cases where it is determined that other school-lev el actors ha ve relev ant
information to share. Interviews will be guided b y semi-structured protocols,
and interview questions will be categoriz ed by topics identified within the
literature. Questions will primarily center around how school-lev el actors are
responding to student interest in AP CSP , constr ained b y capacit y issues, and
navigating the demands of complementary and competing policies and
institutional priorities.
To provide additional context, we will conduct interviews with district
personnel, including staff and leaders of the CS Department, the AP
Department, and each network office. Actors from relev ant departments
within the centr al office will be recruited for interviews based on their
knowledge of how the district is supporting schools under the priorit y of
increasing student participation in AP . In addition to the interview data, we
will collect and analyz e policy documents and written guidance on AP and
other district and school priorities, such as school impro vement plans and
CPS equit y guidance documents. Up to 50 participants will be interviewed
total.
(2) After implementing Exploring Connections activities, teachers will be
interviewed to describe the str ategies that they used to implement the
activities. Interviews with about 10 teachers will be conducted at the end of
the school y ear. The teachers will receiv e a $50 gift card for the interview .
The teacher interviews will tak e no longer than 60 minutes. The location of
the interviews will be arr anged at the con venience of the participants. In-
person interviews could tak e place at the school or at The Learning
Partnership . If social contact is still limited, then the interviews will occur via
Zoom. Interview data will be collected using audio recording devices. These
data will then be tr anscribed, analyz ed, and summariz ed in a report. The
recordings will be deleted once they are tr anscribed.
(3) The CS T eam is dev eloping and refining approaches to support the
professional dev elopment of CS teachers through workshops. The research
seeks to better understand how teacher workshops are impacting teachers’
knowledge, beliefs and skills related to teaching CS . The research will
involve participating in two 30-minute interviews or one 60-minute interview
that will tak e place via Z oom. The teachers will be compensated with a $25
gift card for each 30-minute interview or with a $50 gift card for one 60-
minute interview . All interviews will be audio recorded. These data will then
be transcribed, analyz ed, and summariz ed in a report. The recordings will be
deleted once they are tr anscribed.
Does this involve video, audio, or photograph recording?
YesPlease describe the protocol for audio/video recording
The interviews will begin with introductions of the participant and the
interviewer , and an o verview of the goals of the interview . The researcher will
explain the audio recording and priv acy protections of the interview and
attain v erbal and written consent to proceed with the interview and
recording.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
The interviews with school principals and teachers will be in person with a
digital audio recorder or virtually and audio-recorded.
The audio files will then be tr anscribed b y Automatic S ync Technologies, a
private tr anscription service. The audio files will be uploaded through
Automatic S ync’s secure serv er. The tr anscribed files will be downloaded from
Automatic S ync’s web site. Once the audio has been tr anscribed, the audio
files will be deleted. The Learning P artnership will replace an y names with
pseudon yms and arbitr ary ID numbers. Other identif ying information (e.g. ,
school names) will also be mask ed, by way of the deletion of that information
or through the use of pseudon yms. All data (i.e. , the audio recordings and
transcribed interviews) will be stored in a password-protected, encrypted
server managed b y The Learning P artnership .

CAFÉCS is a researcher -practitioner partnership among The Learning
Partnership , DeP aul, Lo yola, UIC, and the Office of Computer Science.
CAFÉCS supports the implementation of the computer science gr aduation
requirement and the dev elopment of computer science path ways. For 2023-
24, we will continue our research. There are fiv e parts to the research plan.
(1) Teachers attending ECS workshops will be in vited to participate in
interviews about the impact of professional dev elopment. (2) T eachers who
participate in the Exploring Connections progr am will be in vited to
participate in interviews to learn more about their lesson adaptations. (3)
Students in Exploring Connections classrooms will be in vited to gr ant
permission to analyz e their student work. (4) A sample of CPS principals will
be invited to participate in individual interviews to discuss how school-lev el
actors are responding to student interest in AP CSP , constr ained b y capacit y
issues, and na vigating the demands of complementary and competing
policies and institutional priorities.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Modifications/changes in bold
Our research is guided b y the following set of research questions. These
questions will be in vestigated through teacher surv eys, student surv eys,
classroom observ ations, coach focus groups, teacher interviews, and family
focus groups.
The project will be guided b y the following research questions: 
RQ1: How can we increase the number of CPS neighborhood schools that
offer AP CSP?
RQ2: How can we increase the capacity of teachers to make the content of
AP CSP and ECS more culturally responsive and increase equitable student
success in AP CSP and ECS?
 Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The goal of this research is to ensure that ev ery CPS high school offers AP
Computer Science Principles (AP CSP), and success on the AP exam is
equiv alent b y race, ethnicit y, and gender . The project will pro vide systems of
support to address the challenges inherent in preparing all students and
teachers for success in AP CSP and ensure the course is taught using
cultur ally responsiv e pedagogy . An increasing proportion of new AP CSP
teachers do not ha ve a deep background in computer science, and this
project will pro vide content -specific professional dev elopment and ongoing
coaching. T eachers will be scaffolded in implementing cultur ally responsiv e
teaching pr actices in both CSP and Exploring Computer Science through the
Exploring Connections to Computer Science activities and professional
development progr am. These pr actices are especially important for
addressing gaps in course outcomes experienced b y students of color who
are the focus of this research. The project will engage in h ypothesis-driv en
research to identif y factors that predict, facilitate or hinder implementation
of AP CSP in neighborhood schools and create a fr amework of str ategies to
support the district -wide effort to expand AP CSP . 
 Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
(4) A sample of CPS principals will be in vited to participate in individual
interviews to discuss how school-lev el actors are responding to student
interest in AP CSP , constr ained b y capacit y issues, and na vigating the
demands of complementary and competing policies and institutional
priorities.
Part 1: 
CPS is dev eloping and refining approaches to support the professional
development of CS teachers through workshops. The research seeks to
better understand how teacher workshops are impacting teachers’
knowledge, beliefs and skills related to teaching CS . Teachers participating in
CS workshops will be in vited at the workshop if researchers are present, or
after the workshop via email, to participate in the research. The research will
involve participating in two 30-minute interviews or one 60-minute interview
that will tak e place via Z oom. The teachers will be compensated with a $25
gift card for each 30-minute interview or with a $50 gift card for one 60-
minute interview . The research will also in volve granting permission to
review the entries in their workshop journals, which are completed during
the workshop . All interviews will be audio recorded. These data will then be
transcribed, analyz ed, and summariz ed in a report. The recordings will be
deleted once they are tr anscribed.
Part 2:
The research seeks to understand how teachers implement Exploring
Connections to CS activities and the role that professional dev elopment and
curricular scaffolds ha ve on these implementations. After implementing the
activities, the teachers will be interviewed to describe the str ategies that
they used to implement the activities. Interviews with about 25 teachers will
be conducted up to two time points during the school y ear. The teachers will
receiv e a $25 gift card for each interview . The teacher interviews will tak e
no longer than 60 minutes. The location of the interviews will be arr anged at
the con venience of the participants. In-person interviews could tak e place at
the school or at The Learning P artnership . If social contact is still limited,
then the interviews will occur via Z oom. Interview data will be collected
using audio recording devices. These data will then be tr anscribed, analyz ed,
and summariz ed in a report. The recordings will be deleted once they are
transcribed.
Part 3
This research seeks to understand how well students mak e connections
between the content of their computer science course and their liv es.
Students will be engaged in the Exploring Connections activit y in which they
will be articulating their interests, background, and v alues and then makingexplicit connections to the content of the course. The teachers will use the
results of the activit y to mak e adaptations to subsequent lessons in which
they account for students’ interest, background, and v alues. W e seek
permission to collect copies of student work to analyz e how well the
students mak e connections both within the Exploring Connections activit y as
well as the lessons that teachers adapt. The Exploring Connections activities
will occur throughout the y ear. At the completion of each activit y, the
teachers will pro vide the researchers access to the student work. So that the
teacher does not know who has agreed to participate, the teachers will
provide the student work for all students. R esearchers will scan or cop y only
those pieces of student work from consented students. All of the student
work will be returned to the teacher .
Part 4
Based on quantitativ e analysis of school-lev el factors, researchers will
sample 12 schools to serv e as case study examples of AP CSP choice.
Researchers will gather qualitativ e data through interviews with principals,
CS teachers, and guidance counselors. Snowball sampling will be used in
cases where it is determined that other school-lev el actors ha ve relev ant
information to share. Interviews will be guided b y semi-structured protocols,
and interview questions will be categoriz ed by topics identified within the
literature. Questions will primarily center around how school-lev el actors are
responding to student interest in AP CSP , constr ained b y capacit y issues, and
navigating the demands of complementary and competing policies and
institutional priorities. 
 
To provide additional context, we will conduct interviews with district
personnel, including staff and leaders of the CS Department, the AP
Department, and each network office. Actors from relev ant departments
within the centr al office will be recruited for interviews based on their
knowledge of how the district is supporting schools under the priorit y of
increasing student participation in AP . In addition to the interview data, we
will collect and analyz e policy documents and written guidance on AP and
other district and school priorities, such as school impro vement plans and
CPS equit y guidance documents. Up to 50 participants will be interviewed
total.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
The interviews will be guided b y a semi-structured interview protocol. The
interview data and student work will be analyz ed using qualitativ e research
methods, such as open coding (Saldaña, 2019) or thematic analysis
(Riessman, 2008)."

Interviews will tak e place in a priv ate location either in person or via a
video-based platform that is in line with regulations of the three partner
organizations.
For school stak eholders and CHWs, we will conduct interviews in a closed-
door office or via a HIP AA-compliant video-based platform. F or children and
parents participating in home visits, interviews will occur in a priv ate
location within the home or via a HIP AA-compliant video-based platform. F or
any interviews that tak e place via video-based platform, it will be up to the

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Asthma affects one in 12 children and is link ed to poor academic and health
outcomes. Significant asthma disparities exist with Black and Puerto Rican
youth disproportionately affected. Schools represent an important v enue for
providing critical resources to optimiz e asthma management and reduce
disparities. Prior school-based asthma progr ams ha ve demonstr ated the
potential to impro ve outcomes; howev er, they are often tr ansient and rely
on external groups. Tight budgets and competing priorities ha ve contributed
to insufficient nursing support in man y schools.  Therefore, we propose a
progr am that fully integr ates CHWs in schools represents an inno vative
approach to promote a culture of health in schools. 
We have dev eloped an academic -communit y partnership with the expertise,
experience, and leadership to successfully carry this out. Our collabor ation
includes an academic medical center (Univ ersity of Chicago), a communit y-
based research institution in a safet y-net health system (Sinai Urban Health
Institute, SUHI), and a school system (Chicago Public Schools, CPS).  
Our long-term vision is to apply the CHW in schools model to broadly
support children. T o optimiz e feasibilit y, we plan to first integr ate CHWs into
schools with a focus on asthma. T eam members will first dev elop the model
and identif y two schools for this project. The CHW will be hired b y CPS ,
trained b y SUHI, and integr ated in two elementary schools. The CHW will
have two focus areas: impro ving identification of students with asthma and
impro ving asthma management pr actices in school and among families. 
Progr am ev aluation will utiliz e the RE- AIM fr amework to understand reach
and efficacy , along with the process of adoption, implementation, and
maintenance. Primary data will include questionnaires, interviews, logs, and
observ ation forms to ev aluate the CHW in school progr am. Secondary data
will include existing school-lev el surv eys and de-identified student data to
reduce the burden of school staff to complete additional assessments. 
Our goal is to impro ve the health of children b y dev eloping, implementing,
and ev aluating a CHW progr am that is integr ated in schools. W e expect the
CHW will reach 800 children, 50 families, and 100 teachers/staff across two
schools each y ear. Results will be critical to more broadly integr ate CHWs in
schools locally and nationally , expand the work of CHWs into other areas,
and align with state- wide collabor ations exploring reimbursement.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
We seek to understand the impact of communit y health work ers who are
embedded into a school. Specific questions include: How can a CHW
integr ate into a school? What are their k ey responsibilities and activities?
What is the impact of the CHW on students, families, and staff ? We believ e
embedding CHWs in schools can lead to positiv e health and learning
outcomes for children and has potential to positiv ely impact disparities.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Asthma is the most common chronic childhood condition and has been link ed
to poor academic and health outcomes.1 Among one in 12 affected United
States (US) children, o ver half had an exacerbation in the past y ear,
resulting in 13.4 million missed school da ys, 1 million emergency
department (ED) visits, and 140,000 hospitalizations annually .1–3 Children
with asthma also suffer in school attendance, readiness, and
achiev ement.4   
Significant disparities exist in pediatric asthma. Black and Puerto Rican
youth are 2-3 times more lik ely to ha ve asthma than white children. Further ,
these children ha ve 2-5 times higher r ates of hospitalization and ED visits,
compared to whites.1 Studies suggest these disparities ha ve changed little
over the past decades, including in Chicago , due to numerous complex
individual and systems-lev el factors, making asthma disparities a “wick ed
problem” .5,6  
Within communities, schools are tr aditionally viewed as places for learning.
Because children spend a majorit y of their da y in school, the school
environment also represents an important v enue for pro viding critical
resources and progr ams to optimiz e children’ s health and wellness. In light
of the current health issues affecting children, such as asthma, schools
represent a critical point for interv ention. Although prior school-based
asthma progr ams ha ve been pro ven to impro ve knowledge, self -efficacy , and
at times health outcomes, these progr ams are often tr ansient and rely on
external organizations to deliv er education and progr ams.7–9 Therefore,
more robust and sustainable systems of care are needed in schools to
impact asthma disparities. 
  School nurses ha ve traditionally had a critical role in deliv ering health
progr ams and supporting systems of care in schools. Studies show school
nurses ha ve significant positiv e impact on health and educational outcomes
and pro vide cost -effectiv e resources.10 Despite this, US schools are
reducing nursing services due to tight budgets and competing priorities.
Currently , appro ximately half of US schools do not ha ve a full-time school
nurse, contr ary to national recommendations.11 This insufficient school
nursing is an important barrier to chronic disease care.12,13 T raditionally ,
the Chicago Public School (CPS) district has assigned one nurse to 3-5
schools, they are  present at each school one da y per week. While the
student -to-nurse r atio is changing in Chicago , the health needs of students
remain high and opportunities exist to impro ve chronic disease care and
address barriers to learning and health.  
Due to limited school nurses and resources, schools must dev elop and
implement systems of care to deliv er needed health progr ams. Communit y
health work ers (CHWs) represent a potential solution. According to the
American Public Health Association, a communit y health work er is “a
frontline public health work er who is a trusted member of and/or has anunusually close understanding of the communit y serv ed. A communit y
health work er also builds individual and communit y capacit y by increasing
health knowledge and self -sufficiency through a r ange of activities such as
outreach, communit y education, informal counseling, social support and
advocacy .” In the US , CHWs ha ve been in volved in health promotion and
disease prev ention for decades. CHWs ha ve been increasingly utiliz ed in
clinical and communit y settings to facilitate medical care and education,
particularly for minorit y and low -income populations.14 Effectiv e CHW
approaches ha ve been dev eloped and studied in multiple health areas with
studies demonstr ating impro ved knowledge, beha vior, and health outcomes
as well as financial benefits.14,15  
Over the past 20 y ears, Sinai Urban Health Institute (SUHI) has
implemented and meticulously ev aluated a series of nine comprehensiv e
CHW-led interv entions to decrease asthma-related morbidit y and impro ve
the qualit y of life of inner -city children and adults. Across the board, these
progr ams ha ve demonstr ated 70-80% reductions in ED visits and
hospitalizations and also impro ved qualit y of life that are statistically and
clinically significant.28,29 Cost sa vings ha ve also been substantial, r anging
from $2.33 to $7.79 per dollar spent.16–19 While some of these
interv entions ha ve been completed in collabor ation with schools, CHWs ha ve
never been embedded within a school. In light of the significant positiv e
results with CHW -led asthma interv entions in clinic and communit y settings
as well as the challenges that schools face with managing chronic disease
among their students, we believ e embedding CHWs in schools can lead to
positiv e health and learning outcomes for children and has potential to
impact health disparities.","to Date
CHW progr am dev elopment, implementation, and ev aluation are being done
in partnership between the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), Sinai Urban Health
Institute (SUHI), and Univ ersity of Chicago (UC). This progr am integr ates
CHWs into schools to support a culture of health in schools, with a focus on
chronic health conditions giv en their high prev alence and morbidit y in
Chicago . The o verall goal of this CHW progr am is to impro ve identification of
students with chronic health conditions and management in the school
setting and among children/families. The CHWs' role will focus on six areas:
outreach, na vigation, education, adv ocacy , informal counseling, and social
support. This CHW progr am will be implemented as a qualit y impro vement
progr am within two CPS schools and an y child with asthma or chronic
conditions will be eligible for the benefits pro vided through the CHW
progr am. Some children with more sev ere asthma will be eligible for
additional in-person or virtual home visits with the CHW . All children and
their parents as well as school administr ators, teachers, and other staff at
the two schools will be able to participate in all parts of the progr am,
regardless of their enrollment in the research. The CPS Office of Student
Health and W ellness has selected Children and F amily Benefits Unit (CFBU)
coordinators to serv e as CHWs for P arker Communit y Academ y and for

Secondary Data R equestPlease outline your protocol for individual interview activities,
describing when, where, duration, frequency, and with whom.
Interviews will tak e place in a priv ate location either in person or via a
video-based platform that is in line with regulations of the three partner
organizations.
For school stak eholders and CHWs, we will conduct interviews in a closed-
door office or via a HIP AA-compliant video-based platform. F or children and
parents participating in home visits, interviews will occur in a priv ate
location within the home or via a HIP AA-compliant video-based platform. F or
any interviews that tak e place via video-based platform, it will be up to the
participants where they feel comfortable sitting during the interview .
The two CHWs will be ask ed to participate in a semi-structured interview at
the end of the academic y ear focused on understanding the progr am and
their experiences with implementing the progr am. It will tak e appro ximately
one hour to complete.
At the beginning and end of the school y ear, we will in vite k ey stak eholders
(a subset of all administr ators, teachers, and staff at the schools) to
participate in interviews to inform the progr am dev elopment (beginning of
year) and to understand the progr am’s impact and determine potential areas
to be refined (end of the school y ear). These interviews will tak e
appro ximately one hour to complete.
Parents/guardians of children with asthma at the two schools will be in vited
to complete interviews to pro vide feedback about the progr am at the end of
the school y ear. These interviews will tak e appro ximately one hour to
complete.

Questionnaires will be utiliz ed to examine changes in asthma knowledge,
practices, and attitudes. The questionnaires ma y be conducted in person on
paper or web-based via R edcap . If the questionnaire coincides with an in-
person ev ent (e.g. CHW tr aining, education session, professional
development), it will be distributed in person. If the questionnaire is
distributed via web-based format, up to 5 reminders ma y be sent.
Questionnaire of CHWs: A questionnaire will be distributed to the CHWs
before and after tr aining to understand changes in knowledge, skills,
attitudes, and self -efficacy . We will analyz e de-identified questionnaires to
understand changes due to the tr aining.
Questionnaires of administr ators, teachers, and staff: W e will work in
collabor ation with the school principals to distribute a questionnaire to all
school administr ators, teachers, and other staff about asthma policy ,
focusing on knowledge and pr actices. The questionnaire will be distributed at
the start and end of the school y ear.
Questionnaires of parents with education: A questionnaire will be distributed
to the parents before and after asthma education to understand changes in
knowledge, skills, attitudes, and self -efficacy . We will analyz e de-identified
questionnaires to understand changes due to asthma education.
Questionnaires of child/parent at home visits: The CHW will utiliz e validated
questionnaires (e.g. asthma control, asthma impact, self -efficacy , qualit y of
life, inhaler technique) and progr am-specific questionnaires (e.g. healthcare
utilization, en vironmental assessment) during home visits to help guide
education for the family . If the parent consents and (as appropriate) the
child assents, the information pro vided on these questionnaires will be
utilized for analysis. The results will be link ed to child-lev el data pro vided b y
the school about the child’ s asthma and educational outcomes (as part of
the secondary data below).
School-lev el surv eys
The 5Essentials surv ey and Health y CPS surv eys will be utiliz ed to
understand the impact of the CHW progr am on the school en vironment,
culture, and policy implementation.

COVID-19 student and parent surv ey: A t the beginning of this progr am, a
paper copies of the questionnaire disseminated at a back -to-school ev ent all
families within our two CPS schools. This surv ey utiliz ed components of the
Epidemic – P andemic Impacts In ventory (EPII), a tool designed to learn
about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on domains of personal and
family life as well as targeted questions about the pandemic’ s impacts on
proper chronic disease management. Using the results of this surv ey, we will
enhance the support we are pro viding within the schools via tr ained CHWs
embedded in the schools.
Questionnaire for school nurses: T o further support this work and assess
insights from school nursing staff who will work closely with CHWs, we ha ve
included an additional activit y to the progr am to surv ey CPS school nurses at
the end of the 2021-2022 academic y ear to determine areas CHWs can
support for student health. The questionnaire will be disseminated to all
school nursing staff via email as a REDCap link. The questionnaire asks
questions regarding participants' current roles in CPS school nursing,
challenges they are experiencing in supporting student health and ex ecuting
their tasks, experiences working with CHWs, and their perspectiv es on how
CHW could support nurses and student health. This information will help us
inform the dev elopment and implementation of the CHW progr am.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
We restrict access to data collected for our study to study personnel only (via
use of password-protection and lock ed cabinets for study documents). All
survey data will be stored on R edcap . Only the study team will ha ve access
to the k ey that links data to participant contact information. Identified and
de-identified child data will be shared either via REDCap or via a password-
protected ex cel sheet stored on an encrypted Univ ersity of Chicago serv er.
For the COVID-19 questionnaire, these data w as collected with paper surv eys
and is in lock ed cabinet. Additionally , the data is stored on REDCap only
available to the study team. All answers are de-identified ex cept for
participants' email address if they chose to opt into compensation and
contact information if they choose to opt into a CHW contacting them for
further information about the progr am. These PHI elements is stored in a
separ ate REDCap project not with the surv ey answers. There will be no w ay

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Asthma affects one in 12 children and is link ed to poor academic and health
outcomes. Significant asthma disparities exist with Black and Puerto Rican
youth disproportionately affected. Schools represent an important v enue for
providing critical resources to optimiz e asthma management and reduce
disparities. Prior school-based asthma progr ams ha ve demonstr ated the
potential to impro ve outcomes; howev er, they are often tr ansient and rely
on external groups. Tight budgets and competing priorities ha ve contributed
to insufficient nursing support in man y schools.  Therefore, we propose a
progr am that fully integr ates CHWs in schools represents an inno vative
approach to promote a culture of health in schools. 
We have dev eloped an academic -communit y partnership with the expertise,
experience, and leadership to successfully carry this out. Our collabor ation
includes an academic medical center (Univ ersity of Chicago), a communit y-
based research institution in a safet y-net health system (Sinai Urban Health
Institute, SUHI), and a school system (Chicago Public Schools, CPS).  
Our long-term vision is to apply the CHW in schools model to broadly
support children. T o optimiz e feasibilit y, we plan to first integr ate CHWs into
schools with a focus on asthma. T eam members will first dev elop the model
and identif y two schools for this project. The CHW will be hired b y CPS ,
trained b y SUHI, and integr ated in two elementary schools. The CHW will
have two focus areas: impro ving identification of students with asthma and
impro ving asthma management pr actices in school and among families. 
Progr am ev aluation will utiliz e the RE- AIM fr amework to understand reach
and efficacy , along with the process of adoption, implementation, and
maintenance. Primary data will include questionnaires, interviews, logs, and
observ ation forms to ev aluate the CHW in school progr am. Secondary data
will include existing school-lev el surv eys and de-identified student data to
reduce the burden of school staff to complete additional assessments. 
Our goal is to impro ve the health of children b y dev eloping, implementing,
and ev aluating a CHW progr am that is integr ated in schools. W e expect the
CHW will reach 800 children, 50 families, and 100 teachers/staff across two
schools each y ear. Results will be critical to more broadly integr ate CHWs in
schools locally and nationally , expand the work of CHWs into other areas,
and align with state- wide collabor ations exploring reimbursement.   Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
We seek to understand the impact of communit y health work ers who are
embedded into a school. Specific questions include: How can a CHW
integr ate into a school? What are their k ey responsibilities and activities?
What is the impact of the CHW on students, families, and staff ? We believ e
embedding CHWs in schools can lead to positiv e health and learning
outcomes for children and has potential to positiv ely impact disparities.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Asthma is the most common chronic childhood condition and has been link ed
to poor academic and health outcomes.1 Among one in 12 affected United
States (US) children, o ver half had an exacerbation in the past y ear,
resulting in 13.4 million missed school da ys, 1 million emergency
department (ED) visits, and 140,000 hospitalizations annually .1–3 Children
with asthma also suffer in school attendance, readiness, and
achiev ement.4   
Significant disparities exist in pediatric asthma. Black and Puerto Rican
youth are 2-3 times more lik ely to ha ve asthma than white children. Further ,
these children ha ve 2-5 times higher r ates of hospitalization and ED visits,
compared to whites.1 Studies suggest these disparities ha ve changed little
over the past decades, including in Chicago , due to numerous complex
individual and systems-lev el factors, making asthma disparities a “wick ed
problem” .5,6  
Within communities, schools are tr aditionally viewed as places for learning.
Because children spend a majorit y of their da y in school, the school
environment also represents an important v enue for pro viding critical
resources and progr ams to optimiz e children’ s health and wellness. In light
of the current health issues affecting children, such as asthma, schools
represent a critical point for interv ention. Although prior school-based
asthma progr ams ha ve been pro ven to impro ve knowledge, self -efficacy , and
at times health outcomes, these progr ams are often tr ansient and rely on
external organizations to deliv er education and progr ams.7–9 Therefore,
more robust and sustainable systems of care are needed in schools to
impact asthma disparities. 
  School nurses ha ve traditionally had a critical role in deliv ering health
progr ams and supporting systems of care in schools. Studies show school
nurses ha ve significant positiv e impact on health and educational outcomes
and pro vide cost -effectiv e resources.10 Despite this, US schools are
reducing nursing services due to tight budgets and competing priorities.
Currently , appro ximately half of US schools do not ha ve a full-time school
nurse, contr ary to national recommendations.11 This insufficient school
nursing is an important barrier to chronic disease care.12,13 T raditionally ,
the Chicago Public School (CPS) district has assigned one nurse to 3-5
schools, they are  present at each school one da y per week. While the
student -to-nurse r atio is changing in Chicago , the health needs of students
remain high and opportunities exist to impro ve chronic disease care and
address barriers to learning and health.  
Due to limited school nurses and resources, schools must dev elop and
implement systems of care to deliv er needed health progr ams. Communit y
health work ers (CHWs) represent a potential solution. According to the
American Public Health Association, a communit y health work er is “a
frontline public health work er who is a trusted member of and/or has anunusually close understanding of the communit y serv ed. A communit y
health work er also builds individual and communit y capacit y by increasing
health knowledge and self -sufficiency through a r ange of activities such as
outreach, communit y education, informal counseling, social support and
advocacy .” In the US , CHWs ha ve been in volved in health promotion and
disease prev ention for decades. CHWs ha ve been increasingly utiliz ed in
clinical and communit y settings to facilitate medical care and education,
particularly for minorit y and low -income populations.14 Effectiv e CHW
approaches ha ve been dev eloped and studied in multiple health areas with
studies demonstr ating impro ved knowledge, beha vior, and health outcomes
as well as financial benefits.14,15  
Over the past 20 y ears, Sinai Urban Health Institute (SUHI) has
implemented and meticulously ev aluated a series of nine comprehensiv e
CHW-led interv entions to decrease asthma-related morbidit y and impro ve
the qualit y of life of inner -city children and adults. Across the board, these
progr ams ha ve demonstr ated 70-80% reductions in ED visits and
hospitalizations and also impro ved qualit y of life that are statistically and
clinically significant.28,29 Cost sa vings ha ve also been substantial, r anging
from $2.33 to $7.79 per dollar spent.16–19 While some of these
interv entions ha ve been completed in collabor ation with schools, CHWs ha ve
never been embedded within a school. In light of the significant positiv e
results with CHW -led asthma interv entions in clinic and communit y settings
as well as the challenges that schools face with managing chronic disease
among their students, we believ e embedding CHWs in schools can lead to
positiv e health and learning outcomes for children and has potential to
impact health disparities.  Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
To impro ve asthma management in the school en vironment, CHWs will
provide asthma education for staff , children, and parents as well as support
adherence to school-based asthma policies (i.e. ensure medication
availabilit y and appropriate use in the schools). T o impro ve identification of
children with asthma in school, CHWs will utiliz e the Student Medical
Information F orm and conduct asthma screenings. A v alidated tool – Brief
Pediatric Asthma Screen22 – will be utiliz ed to identif y students at the
school with asthma and children with symptoms of asthma but no prior
diagnosis. 
For all children at the school identified to ha ve asthma or asthma symptoms,
CHWs will deliv er targeted services based on the unique needs of each child
and family . These services ma y involve individualiz ed asthma education,
screening for adv erse social determinants of health, referr als to care and
services, assistance with 504 plans/Individualiz ed Education Plans, and
follow -up. 
For children most sev erely affected b y asthma (e.g. poorly controlled
asthma, high absenteeism, or other high-risk factors), CHWs will conduct
home visits in-person or virtually . For interested families, CHWs will conduct
1-3 home visits with each family o ver the course of the y ear, with each visit
lasting 1-2 hours.  
Questionnaires will be utiliz ed to examine changes in asthma knowledge,
practices, and attitudes. Interviews will be utiliz ed to understand the
implementation of the CHW in school progr am to elicit the implementation
process, adaptations made, resources needed, costs of the progr am as well
as facilitators and barriers to the progr am. Select parents, children,
administr ators, teachers, and other staff will be ask ed to participate in
questionnaires and interviews, which will be conducted either in-person or
virtually . 
See protocol for detailed description of all activities and in volvement.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
We will use a pre-post study design to ev aluate the progr am where CHWs
are integr ated into 2 CPS elementary schools. One CHW will be assigned to
each school and will focus on asthma. F or each school y ear, assessments will
be completed at baseline, during the school y ear, and at the end of the
school y ear.  
The CHW progr am will be ev aluated utilizing the RE- AIM fr amework, often
applied for public health interv entions. The study will focus on the progr am’s
reach and efficacy , along with the process of adoption, implementation, and
maintenance. F or each step , necessary resources, facilitators, and barriers
will be assessed. Data will be gathered about participation, processes, and
adaptations made at each school during CHW integr ation in the schools and
upon refinement. Data will be a combination of primary and secondary data
sources.  
This progr am will be ev aluated based on a v ariety of outcomes based on 5
domains:  
Process outcomes 
CHW activities and engagement – tr aining, asthma screening, children
receiving individualiz ed asthma education, parents receiving asthma
education, families with social determinants of health screening, home

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
In July 2021, the Chicago Public Schools launched its first -ever online
curriculum, known as Skyline, in an effort to ensure that all its students
have access to high qualit y, grade appropriate, and cultur ally relev ant
instructional materials. The project w as conceiv ed in 2019 when a surv ey of
500 CPS teachers found that nearly half of all respondents reported that
their schools did not pro vide curricula in the areas in which they teach, and
over 40 percent of respondents spent between 2 and 5 hours each week
searching for instructional resources. While Skyline is a vailable to all
teachers in the district, schools were ask ed to commit to adopting at least
one course at one gr ade lev el in order to receiv e district -provided support
related to the curriculum (e.g. professional learning opportunities, kits
including non-digital materials).
As part of a broader mix ed-methods in vestigation of Skyline's early
implementation, we propose an explor atory qualitativ e study designed to

subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The qualit y of instructional materials can pla y an important role in how much
students learn (Oak es & Saunders, 2002). R esearch has shown that students
who begin the school y ear substantially below gr ade lev el are more lik ely to
close the achiev ement gap when ask ed to work on gr ade-appropriate
material, but man y students are not exposed to such material and as a
result fall further behind (TNTP , 2018).
Increasing teachers’ and students’ access to high qualit y, standards- aligned,
cultur ally relev ant instructional materials is a k ey component of CPS’
approach for acceler ating liter acy dev elopment with Skyline. The district has
curated and dev eloped a comprehensiv e K-12 English language arts
curriculum that is standards- aligned,  cultur ally relev ant,  and centered in
Chicago . Equally important is ensuring that these materials are used in w ays
that affirm students’ identities and elev ate student v oice, making
professional learning another k ey aspect of the district plan. Cultur ally-
relevant texts support students’ comprehension and engagement, as school
learning must be connected to students’ prior knowledge and experiences,
making the learning experience relev ant and affirming.
The Skyline curriculum initiativ e also contains embedded formativ e and
summativ e assessments tied to the instructional resources. F ormativ e
assessments pla y a key role in helping teachers identif y learning gaps and
assess progress on gr ade lev el content mastery . “Using high-qualit y
assessments, such as diagnostic and formativ e assessments that pro vide
timely information to help educators know where to focus for particular
students without tr acking students or serving them inequitably” is the
second k ey approach named b y the US SE Handbook (p . 18).  
Each of these str ategies for acceler ating liter acy dev elopment must be
undergirded b y professional learning supports that dev elop strong
instructional pr actice for all teachers, and especially for teachers of students
most impacted negativ ely by the pandemic. T o support teacher pr actice, CPS
has committed to a model of curriculum-focused professional learning. This
approach, dev eloped b y Carnegie Corpor ation, pro vides opportunities for
teachers to experience instruction in the same w ays their students do , in
small group sessions organiz ed lik e a typical lesson. The focus is squarely on
the curriculum and pro vides opportunities for teachers to wrestle with
different instructional approaches, deepen their content knowledge, and
rehearse their lessons.    
Given the potential for Skyline to mak e a significant impact on teaching and
learning, the UChicago Consortium on School R esearch has outlined 9-month
mixed-methods study of this new initiativ e. The project has four discrete but
interconnected components, which are designed to gener ate formativ e
insights into the dynamics of implementation and school-lev el engagement
with the materials and resources associated with Skyline.","to Date
The UChicago Consortium successfully completed the named explor atory

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
In July 2021, the Chicago Public Schools launched its first -ever online
curriculum, known as Skyline, in an effort to ensure that all its students
have access to high qualit y, grade appropriate, and cultur ally relev ant
instructional materials. The project w as conceiv ed in 2019 when a surv ey of
500 CPS teachers found that nearly half of all respondents reported that
their schools did not pro vide curricula in the areas in which they teach, and
over 40 percent of respondents spent between 2 and 5 hours each week
searching for instructional resources. While Skyline is a vailable to all
teachers in the district, schools were ask ed to commit to adopting at least
one course at one gr ade lev el in order to receiv e district -provided support
related to the curriculum (e.g. professional learning opportunities, kits
including non-digital materials).
As part of a broader mix ed-methods in vestigation of Skyline's early
implementation, we propose an explor atory qualitativ e study designed to
gener ate formativ e insights into the dynamics of district -wide
implementation and school-lev el engagement with materials and resources
associated with Skyline. The purpose of the qualitativ e study is to
understand and char acteriz e the early goals and expectations of district -level
departments and personnel charged with administering and supporting
Skyline’ s initial for ay into schools. Findings will highlight systems and
processes that appear to facilitate meaningful inter action with Skyline
resources, while also outlining opportunities for in vestment of further effort.
The discussion will lev erage these findings to pro vide actionable feedback
that informs policy and support for implementation. Findings from this work
will also guide future research aimed at char acterizing v ariation and patterns
in schools’ engagement with Skyline resources.

This qualitativ e research study is guided b y the following research questions:
1. Based on interviews with centr al office personnel, what goals do district
stakeholders ha ve for teacher and student engagement with the Skyline
curriculum initiativ e? What materials, resources, and supports has the
district committed to the implementation of the Skyline initiativ e?
2. Based on interviews with instructional leaders, what factors influence the

Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this

The qualit y of instructional materials can pla y an important role in how much
students learn (Oak es & Saunders, 2002). R esearch has shown that students
who begin the school y ear substantially below gr ade lev el are more lik ely to
close the achiev ement gap when ask ed to work on gr ade-appropriate

Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
We will utiliz e in-depth qualitativ e interviews with k ey stak eholders to
understand the goals, structures, and dynamics of early implementation of
the Skyline curriculum initiativ e in CPS . Semi-structured interviews with
district personnel in roles or offices responsible for curriculum and
instruction (e.g. , Teaching and Learning), school leadership and professional
learning (e.g. , Office of Network Support), and equit y-centered school
transformation (e.g. , Office of Equit y) will focus on district objectiv es for the
current phase of implementation, policies and plans for supporting Skyline’ s
uptak e in schools, assessment and monitoring, and the status of ongoing
curricular and professional dev elopment. Interviews with instructional
leaders (e.g. , school principals or IL T department leads) within schools will
center on pr actitioners’ experiences with and perceptions of the Skyline
resources and materials, to date, as well as needs for support to scale,
impro ve, or monitor schools’ engagement.
This study in volves participants from multiple groups in volved in the design,
implementation, and assessment of the Skyline initiativ e in CPS , including:
-Staff in the Office of T eaching & Learning, Office of Network Support, Office
of Assessment, and Office of Libr aries and Educational T echnology
-Network chiefs (appro ximately 3-5)
-school leaders from 3-5 CPS schools currently utilizing Skyline resources
FOR ALL P ARTICIP ANT GROUPS:
No experimental interv entions or tasks are associated with participation in
this study .
Audio from the interviews/focus groups will be digitally recorded, with
participants' consent. Individuals can elect to skip or decline an y questions
asked of them. They ma y also discontinue their participation at an y time.
Individuals ma y request that the audio recorder be shut off for an y section
of their interview/focus group; they are also reminded that their data are
solely utiliz ed for research purposes, are stored confidentially , and that their
personal identif ying information is not shared as part of an y report or
presentation of findings.
After the interviews/focus groups, participants will retain contact information
for the principal in vestigator and the UChicago institutional review board.
They are encour aged to contact IRB or the researcher with an y questions or
concerns that arise following participation.
There are no expectations of subsequent in volvement b y research
participants bey ond the interview/focus group sessions.
PROCEDURES FOR DISTRICT AND SCHOOL ST AFF: District and school staff
will be in vited to participate in one-on-one interviews with a member of the
research team. A t this time, we anticipate the majorit y of data collection
activities will occur online using a secure, encrypted video conference
platform (e.g. , Google Meet). If guidelines for conducting research in schools
changes (in light of the COVID pandemic response), participants will begiven the opportunit y to choose whether to conduct interviews in person or
online.
Participants will ha ve the opportunit y to select the time and location of the
interview . Interview dur ation will be determined b y staff schedules and will
utilize appro ximately one hour (60 minutes) of participants' time. Interview
questions are designed to gain nuanced descriptiv e insights into the aims,
design, and implementation of Skyline across CPS .","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
The study proposed in volves the collection of data from semi-structured
interviews and focus groups designed to elicit the beliefs and understandings
of individuals in volved in the design and/or implementation of the Skyline
curricular initiativ e. The study design emplo ys basic qualitativ e research
methods to conduct interviews. Due to restrictions imposed in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, in person data collection will be replaced b y
synchronous, online data collection using an encrypted video conference
platform.
Analytic str ategies will include tr anscription of interview audio files, thematic
and grounded coding of tr anscript data, analytic memoing, and within and
cross case comparisons. The goals of analysis are both explor atory and
descriptiv e to pro vide insight into individuals' sensemaking and decisions,
and further , to account for and illustr ate potentially meaningful patterns. W e
will utiliz e an interpretiv e analytic approach to deriv e meaning from themes
and cases, in order to shed light on factors that influence schools'
engagement with Skyline materials and resources.
AMENDMENT - 09/03/2024
As part of the 2022 field scan study , I conducted 36 interviews with 27
district, network, and school leaders. Interviewees were ask ed to describe
their experiences, understandings, and perceptions of the curriculum
development process and product launch. Accounts from multiple
interviewees pro vided salient insight into the district's goals and theory of
action. I plan to incorpor ate brief , deidentified ex cerpts from interview
transcripts into reports of research findings from the current Skyline K2
Literacy Study .
All personally identifiable information w as remo ved from the 2022 interviews
as part of initial tr anscript conditioning. I replaced institutional identifiers
(e.g., department or team names) with generic departmental labels intended
to demarcate the scope of v arious teams' in volvement.
We propose contacting a subset of Field Scan participants (appro ximately
10-12 current or former CPS Centr al Office staff members) to request
permission to use their existing interview data in service of the new Skyline
study . (See attached P ermission Letter .) 
In accordance with the 2022 human subjects application, we ha ve
maintained a k eyed roster linking participant IDs with individuals' names
and contact information. W e will utiliz e this information to reach out to the
subset of participants - via email - with the permission letter . The permission
letter indicates that recipients can RESPOND T O THE EMAIL / letter to gr ant
permission for secondary use of their data, decline, or ask questions of the
research team.
We will store PDF copies of response emails in a secure folder with thestudy's original consent data."

The assistant principal position is often o verlook ed between the principal and
teacher . Howev er, APs serv e an important instructional and administr ative
function and are a k ey lev er to school impro vement. They also serv e as an
important talent pool for the principal and district leadership positions and
are an important w ay to learn k ey administr ative skills.
Given the importance of the AP role, The Chicago Public Education Fund
plans to surv ey all of Chicago's public school assistant principals to better
understand their satisfaction, professional dev elopment needs and the
barriers to school leadership for candidates of color .
The surv ey will pro vide a historical trend that can help district leaders and
external partners mak e policy and progr ammatic decisions to support these
critical leaders and impro ve their performance in role and through the school
leadership pipeline. This will build on our existing portfolio of work in
conducting surv eys with Chicago's administr ators to better understand their
needs and experience as leaders in CPS .","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Since 2015, The Chicago Public Education Fund (The Fund) has conducted a
survey of all Chicago's public school principals on their satisfaction,
professional dev elopment needs and how to retain them. This surv ey has
helped meaningful contribute to CPS district policy around compensation and
retention and has informed professional dev elopment pro vided b y The Fund
and our partners. The surv ey has also increased a wareness around the
importance of principals in education.
The Assistant Principal Engagement Surv ey hopes to pro vide a similar
opportunit y for assistant principals. The data will be used b y CPS , The Fund
and other partners to help collectiv ely impro ve the satisfaction of APs as well
as collabor atively pro vide meaningful support for APs to impro ve in their
roles and help reduce barriers to the principalship , especially for leaders of
color.
The AP surv ey also will be used to continue to add to the APs Rising suite of
progr ams that are designed for assistant principals interested in the principal
role and for progr ams for APs looking to impro ve in their current roles.
We believ e this is especially important in the w ake of the pandemic and the
changing role of schools. The satisfaction for all educators is down and we
know that this can help us to mak e concrete changes that can impro ve the
retention and performance of APs cit ywide.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
There is an established link that effectiv e principals ha ve positiv e impacts on
student achiev ement. New research suggests that this link ma y even be
stronger than originally thought. Howev er, relativ ely little research has been
done on the other k ey administr ative role in schools: the assistant principal.
Assistant principals serv e a key administr ative, instructional and cultur al
function in schools and are a k ey lev er to the school leadership pipeline. The
purpose of this research is to be a pulse check on the satisfaction   of
current APs and to mak e direct policy changes to retain strong leaders in
their roles. It is also an opportunit y for CPS and its external partners to
understand the barriers to the principalship , especially for Black male and
Latinx leaders. Currently , there are both significant gaps in representation in
CPS principals and assistant principals and The Fund can help to be a k ey
partner in breaking down some of these barriers for future leaders.

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The assistant principal position is often o verlook ed between the principal and
teacher . Howev er, APs serv e an important instructional and administr ative
function and are a k ey lev er to school impro vement. They also serv e as an
important talent pool for the principal and district leadership positions and
are an important w ay to learn k ey administr ative skills.
Given the importance of the AP role, The Chicago Public Education Fund
plans to surv ey all of Chicago's public school assistant principals to better
understand their satisfaction, professional dev elopment needs and the
barriers to school leadership for candidates of color .
The surv ey will pro vide a historical trend that can help district leaders and
external partners mak e policy and progr ammatic decisions to support these
critical leaders and impro ve their performance in role and through the school
leadership pipeline. This will build on our existing portfolio of work in
conducting surv eys with Chicago's administr ators to better understand their
needs and experience as leaders in CPS .Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Since 2015, The Chicago Public Education Fund (The Fund) has conducted a
survey of all Chicago's public school principals on their satisfaction,
professional dev elopment needs and how to retain them. This surv ey has
helped meaningful contribute to CPS district policy around compensation and
retention and has informed professional dev elopment pro vided b y The Fund
and our partners. The surv ey has also increased a wareness around the
importance of principals in education.
The Assistant Principal Engagement Surv ey hopes to pro vide a similar
opportunit y for assistant principals. The data will be used b y CPS , The Fund
and other partners to help collectiv ely impro ve the satisfaction of APs as well
as collabor atively pro vide meaningful support for APs to impro ve in their
roles and help reduce barriers to the principalship , especially for leaders of
color.
The AP surv ey also will be used to continue to add to the APs Rising suite of
progr ams that are designed for assistant principals interested in the principal
role and for progr ams for APs looking to impro ve in their current roles.
We believ e this is especially important in the w ake of the pandemic and the
changing role of schools. The satisfaction for all educators is down and we
know that this can help us to mak e concrete changes that can impro ve the
retention and performance of APs cit ywide.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
There is an established link that effectiv e principals ha ve positiv e impacts on
student achiev ement. New research suggests that this link ma y even be
stronger than originally thought. Howev er, relativ ely little research has been
done on the other k ey administr ative role in schools: the assistant principal.
Assistant principals serv e a key administr ative, instructional and cultur al
function in schools and are a k ey lev er to the school leadership pipeline. The
purpose of this research is to be a pulse check on the satisfaction   of
current APs and to mak e direct policy changes to retain strong leaders in
their roles. It is also an opportunit y for CPS and its external partners to
understand the barriers to the principalship , especially for Black male and
Latinx leaders. Currently , there are both significant gaps in representation in
CPS principals and assistant principals and The Fund can help to be a k ey
partner in breaking down some of these barriers for future leaders.

Teachers are lea ving the teaching profession at alarming r ates, causing a
worldwide teacher shortage. School leaders pla y an important role in the
attrition and/or retention of teachers. The support pro vided b y school
leaders is critical for no vice teachers as they ha ve the highest attrition r ates.
The problem is the high teacher attrition r ate in high-po verty areas among
K-8 teachers in a northern Illinois school district. The purpose of this
qualitativ e case study is to explore the perceptions of teachers on the impact
of principal support on teacher attrition in high-po verty areas among K -8
teachers with 1-5 y ears of experience who ha ve considered lea ving the
profession in a northern Illinois school district. Three research questions
focus on teacher perceptions on the impact of principal support on teacher
attrition. The study fills gaps in the liter ature b y exploring teacher
perceptions of the influence of principal support on teacher attrition. Guided
by Herzberg’ s theory of motiv ation and the tr ansformational leadership
theory , the research question addresses teachers’ perceptions of the support
their principals pro vide. This descriptiv e case study will include the
perception of teachers with 1-5 y ears of teaching experience with a sample
size of 15 participants. All participants are K -8 grade teachers from a
northern Illinois school district. Data will be collected through structured

While there ha ve been a number of studies on teacher attrition, man y of
them focus on the gener al stressors of teachers that cause them to lea ve the
profession (Madigan, 2021; Dohert y, 2020). There are few studies focused
on principal support and its impact on teacher attrition as perceiv ed by
teachers.","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
Virtual one-on-one interviews will be conducted with participants, using the
Google Meets platform. The questions ask ed during the interview were self -
created and open-ended, allowing the participants to share their perceptions
of the impact of principal support on teacher attrition. Interview questions 
are designed to answer the research questions: What are teacher
perceptions of factors that influence teacher attrition? What are the
perceptions of teachers on principal support that influence their attrition in
an urban northern Illinois school district? This alignment is important to the
outcome of the study as the purpose of the interview is to gather data to
answer the research questions (Durdella, 2020). Semi-structured interviews
allow for flexibilit y in the interview process, where more information ma y be
gained from the participants about the research topic (Durdella, 2020).","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
A qualitativ e research method will be used for this study . The design used in
this qualitativ e study is a case study . The design is suitable for answering
the research questions because it will allow participants to describe their
perceptions teacher attrition and the influence of leadership support on
teacher attrition. The t ype of case study that will be used in this study is a
descriptiv e case study .  The descriptiv e case study is suitable as it will allow
participants to share perceptions and describe the situations, they face and
how it influences their decision-making for the future of their careers.
Thematic analysis will be used to analyz e the data collected in the study . 
These steps include gathering the data, reading the data, coding, the data,
gener ating themes, and reporting the findings.
The first step includes collecting data from the structured interview
questions. The data collected during this process will be con verted from
audio to text using the tr anscribe feature on Google Meet. T ranscriptions will
be shared with participants to ensure accur acy. This member checking
procedure increased the credibilit y of the data (McKim, 2023). The next step
is verifying tr anscripts to be uploaded into MAXQDA for open coding. Next,
open coding will be used to identif y words and phr ases related to the
research questions to identif y categories (Naeem, et. al. , 2023). These
codes will be read sev eral times to create categories. Next, subcategories
will be created based on the theoretical fr ameworks identified in the study .
The subcategories will be used to gener ate themes. Identified themes will be
displa yed in charts and tables. The next step is identif ying similar responses
or themes that arise from listening to recordings. The final step is writing a
summary report of the identified themes using examples from the data
(Miller , 2023)."

Over the past decade, Bo ys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) and local Bo ys &
Girls Clubs ha ve built their capacit y to collect and use data to measure y outh
outcomes, gauge progr am qualit y, identif y crucial staff pr actices, and
demonstr ate their impact to stak eholders. This data enables Clubs to assess
theirefficacy and mak e impro vements to pro vide Club members with a high-

2011, BGCApartnered with Y outh Dev elopment Str ategies, Inc. and the
Institute for R esearchand R eform in Education to dev elop, test and v alidate a

change. The work included dev eloping a set of questions that measure
members’ experiences in the Club , as defined b y the Fiv e Key Elements for
Positiv e Youth Dev elopment at the center of FFI. BGCA incorpor ated this set of
measures, known collectiv ely as the ClubExperience indicator , into the National

Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
 
 
Are our members benefiting from the club experience?
Are our progr am outcomes conforming to the fiv e key elements for positiv e
youth dev elopment: Create a safe, positiv e environment; Gener ate fun and
foster a sense of belonging; Encour age supportiv e relationships with peers and
adults; Pro vide opportunities; set expectations; and offer recognition.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
 
Over the past decade, Bo ys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) and local Bo ys &
Girls Clubs ha ve built their capacit y to collect and use data to measure y outh
outcomes, gauge progr am qualit y, identif y crucial staff pr actices, and
demonstr ate their impact to stak eholders. This data enables Clubs to assess
theirefficacy and mak e impro vements to pro vide Club members with a high-
qualit yClub Experience that will ha ve a lifelong positiv e impact on them. In
2011, BGCApartnered with Y outh Dev elopment Str ategies, Inc. and the
Institute for R esearchand R eform in Education to dev elop, test and v alidate a
member surv ey based onour Mo vement ’s Formula for Impact (FFI) theory of
change. The work included dev eloping a set of questions that measure
members’ experiences in the Club , as defined b y the Fiv e Key Elements for
Positiv e Youth Dev elopment at the center of FFI. BGCA incorpor ated this set of
measures, known collectiv ely as the ClubExperience indicator , into the National
Youth Outcomes Initiativ e (NY OI) MemberSurv ey. Analysis of NY OI data on the
Club Experience o ver the past six y ears hasgener ated a number of k ey insights
that influenced the goal and priorities of theMo vement ’s new Great Futures
2025 str ategic plan. This report is for Club leaders, such as CEOs, oper ations
directors, site directors, board chairs and board members. It pro vides a greater
understanding of what a high-qualit y ClubExperience is, wh y it is important,
and k ey driv ers for impro vement. It offers insights for impro ving progr am
qualit y, as measured b y the Club Experience indicator . Its findings ha ve
implications for Club oper ations, progr amming and staff pr actices. The k ey
insights are: When children and teens ha ve a high-qualit y Club Experience,
they are more lik ely to achiev e positiv e academic, char acter and health
outcomes. Although 38 percent of Club members reported an optimal Club
Experience in 2017, this percentage v aries widely across the Bo ys & Girls Club
network, especially based on members’ age, the t ype of Club they frequent,
andClubs’ a verage daily attendance (ADA). Y outh dev elopment pr actices
matterimmensely . In Clubs that report high-qualit y youth dev elopment
practices, members are more lik ely to ha ve an optimal Club Experience.
Management pr actices also matter greatly . More members report an optimal
Club Experience when Club staff report that they receiv e professional
development, are satisfiedwith their work, and ha ve effectiv e staff meetings.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus

To address the academic and social emotional needs of the students, CRCL
will use the multi-tiered systems of support (MT SS) to pro vide in-classroom
progr ams, family nights and workshops for ev ery student in the school, 230
students. In the progr am area of kindergarten readiness, according to the
National R eading P anel’s review of studies, when kindergartners receiv ed
direct and explicit phonological a wareness tr aining, substantial letter -sound
instruction, and instruction that connects these two skills, the number of
struggling readers in later gr ades w as drastically reduced (NICHD , 2000).
Based on these findings, CRCL ’s reading initiativ e at the classroom

Over the last two y ears, our team has collected a teacher surv ey at the end
of each y ear. We also look ed at student attendance, gr ades, and
standardiz ed test scores from the 2022-23 progr am year and hope to
receiv e the 2023-24 data soon.
View xForm - Research Review Board (RRB) SubmissionPreliminary Results to Date
To date, teachers are reporting moder ate impro vement in student academic
performance and social-emotional wellbeing. F or example, teachers reported
68% of students who participated in out of school time progr amming
impro ved in their language arts / reading abilities.
Given that 2022-23 w as the first y ear we’v e had the opportunit y to access
this data, we hope to later tr ack how student academic achiev ement
changes o ver time. The following summariz es the data for students in 2022-
23 progr amming.
The IAR growth percentile w as available for 8 students. These students
averaged in the 46th growth percentile in Math and the 44th percentile in
ELA.
Math IAR scores were a vailable for 13 students. 69% did not meet
expectations, 8% partially met expectations, and 23% approached
expectations.
ELA IAR scores were a vailable for 12 students. 33% did not meet
expectations, 58% partially met expectations, and 8% met expectations.
Report card gr ades were a vailable for 20 students. Across reading, math,
social sciences, and writing, no student receiv ed a final gr ade of an F in an y
class, and only 2 students receiv ed a D , both of which were in math.
Students receiv ed roughly an ev en number of As, Bs, and Cs -- 28, 29, and
21, respectiv ely. The majorit y of Cs were concentr ated in reading in writing.
While teachers are reporting impro vement in man y students who are
attending OST progr amming, it ’s clear from student gr ades and test scores
that there’ s still opportunit y for growth and this will remain a focus for
progr amming in future y ears.

impro ve. This data will be combined with student data, such as attendance
records and gr ades, to gather a more holistic picture of each student to find
where we can best impact their wellbeing and dev elopment.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Research questions for this study include the following:
Is the Carole R obertson Center for Learning/La wndale Communit y
Academ y 21st CCL C progr am reaching the target population?
How well are the progr am activities aligned with the goals and
objectiv es of ISBE’ s 21st CCL C progr am?
Is the 21st CCL C progr am contributing to an increase in academic
achiev ement for student participants?
Is the 21st CCL C progr am contributing to an increase in school
activit y participation for student participants?
Is the 21st CCL C progr am contributing to an increase in social
benefits and social emotional skills for student participants?
We hypothesiz e that students who participate in the 21st CCL C progr am for
30 da ys or more will experience impro vements in academic achiev ement,
participation in school activities, and will impro ve both socially and
behaviorally.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Communit y Learning Centers progr am w as
created in 1994 b y ESEA and expanded in 2001 b y the No Child Left Behind
Act (NCLB) to pro vide students in high-need, high-po verty - 8 - communities
the opportunit y to participate in after -school progr amming. These academic
enrichment and y outh dev elopment progr ams are present in all 50 states,
the District of Columbia, and three territories and are designed to enhance
participants’ well-being and academic success. States were giv en the 21st
CCLC funds from the U .S. Department of Education (ED) as formula funds in
2002 to be managed as statewide competitions and a ward gr ants to eligible
entities.
The purpose of this study is to in vestigate the designated 21st Century
Communit y Learning Center ’s (21st CCL C) progress tow ard achieving its
goals and objectiv es. Results from this research and ev aluation process will
be used to refine, impro ve, and strengthen the progr am at La wndale
Communit y Academ y and to pro vide data that will contribute to the refining
of the Illinois State Board of Education’ s (ISBE) 21st CCL C performance
measures. More specifically , the research and ev aluation process will explore
the progress that the site is making tow ards student academic achiev ement,
student in volvement in school activities, the progr am’s social benefits, staff
professional dev elopment, and progr am sustainabilit y.
The Carole R obertson Center for Learning (CRCL) and La wndale Communit y
Academ y’s (LCA) 21st CCL C progr am is an inno vative after school progr am
designed to meet the needs of students at L CA, focused on social and
emotional learning, family and communit y engagement, STEAM education
progr amming, reading and liter acy education, and ph ysical education and
health activities to prepare students for a 21st century global societ y while
also increasing student achiev ement in math, science, and reading.
Following the Communit y Schools Pla ybook, created b y the Learning P olicy
Institute, the four main pillars are integr ated student supports, expanded
and enriched learning time and opportunities, activ e family and communit y
engagement, and collabor ative leadership and pr actices.  
 
To address the academic and social emotional needs of the students, CRCL
will use the multi-tiered systems of support (MT SS) to pro vide in-classroom
progr ams, family nights and workshops for ev ery student in the school, 230
students. In the progr am area of kindergarten readiness, according to the
National R eading P anel’s review of studies, when kindergartners receiv ed
direct and explicit phonological a wareness tr aining, substantial letter -sound
instruction, and instruction that connects these two skills, the number of
struggling readers in later gr ades w as drastically reduced (NICHD , 2000).
Based on these findings, CRCL ’s reading initiativ e at the classroom
kindergarten lev el includes daily lessons using the Michael Heggert y
phonemic a wareness curriculum as well as phoneme-gr apheme (letter -
sound) knowledge through multi-sensory activities and games. 
 The research design and methods for this project are informed b y the United
States Department of Education's Ev aluation Fr amework for 21st CCL C
Progr ams, created in partnership with Berk eley P olicy Associates (BP A) and
American Institutes for R esearch (AIR). F or the purposes of this study , we
will use a comparison group design, which is a quasi-experimental design
that will compare outcomes between La wndale Communit y Academ y’s
student participants with students across the district and the state. District
and state a verages will be used as a benchmark against which the progr am
to gauge relativ e success in academic achiev ement and attendance o ver
time. Additionally , the study will implement a single group pre-/post -test
design. While this design is not as rigorous as the comparison group design,
will pro vide a measure of change for the individual student progr am
participants. Both designs will be informed b y the collection of the following
student and stak eholder data: standardiz ed test scores, gr ades, and
implementation data (e.g. , observing after -school classrooms, surv eys about
progr am perception, collecting information about progr am qualit y). Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement

• Face more cognitiv e barriers such as stress and other factors;
• Expect a lower return on in vestment in their children.

Abstract
This Psy chiatric -Mental Health Nurse Pr actitioner , Doctor ate of Nursing
Practice (PMHNP-DNP) qualit y impro vement project aims to address the
underutilization of psy chiatric services within School-Based Health Centers
(SBHCs) at three Chicago public high schools: W endell Phillips Academ y, Orr
Academ y, and Richard T . Crane Medical Prep High School. These schools
serve predominantly Black and Latino student populations, who are
disproportionately affected b y the rising post -pandemic mental health needs.
The project seeks to identif y barriers to psy chiatric service utilization b y
conducting de-identified stak eholder interviews, site observ ations, and
anonymous surv eys. Data will be analyz ed using institution-secured
REDCap , with the goal of dev eloping a comprehensiv e understanding of the
factors contributing to the unev en use of psy chiatric services. The findings
will inform the creation of a workflow map detailing referr al processes within
SBHCs and will engage non- SBHC stak eholders to enhance a wareness and
access to psy chiatric care.
Guided b y the K ellogg Logic Model, this project will pro vide actionable
insights to impro ve psy chiatric service deliv ery in SBHCs, ultimately aiming
to bridge the gap in mental health care access for marginaliz ed student
communities. The project underscores the importance of equitable
psychiatric care and striv es to foster a more accessible and effectiv e mental
health support system within Chicago public schools.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Despite the a vailabilit y of services on the three sites, low utilization of
psychiatric services persist in the SBHCs, necessitating a comprehensiv e
evaluation to identif y barriers and facilitate equitable care. The primary aim
of this study is to assess knowledge, and attitudes of psy chiatric care offered
at CPS and to identif y any potential pipelines for referr als to care.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
A review of the liter ature underscores the significance of SBHCs in
addressing the mental health needs of adolescents, supported b y key
findings from relev ant studies. A liter ature review w as conducted with the
search terms: “school-based health centers” “mental health” “adolescents”
and “utilization” . PubMed and Ovid were searched for peer -reviewed journals
between the y ears of 2018 to 2023. Other criteria were for studies
conducted in the United States with English-only citations.
In the face of escalating national shortages in psy chiatric -mental health
services for y outh, Duong et al.'s 2021 meta- analysis of the liter ature
underscores SBHCs' efficacy in remo ving barriers for students from health-
dispar ate communities, particularly benefiting those without health
insurance (Duong, et al. , 2021). Their meta- analysis rev eals that 7.28% of
adolescents receiv e psy chiatric -mental health care at SBHCs, making them a
significant mental health service setting. F or those with adv anced psy chiatric
needs, SBHCs serv e 22.10%, surpassing other settings. The study also
highlights the positiv e impact of telehealth services and reports high
satisfaction among students utilizing SBHCs, emphasizing their crucial role in
addressing the growing mental health needs of the y outh.
Gruber et al.'s 2021 study highlights that the scope of services offered b y
SBHCs is often constr ained b y regulatory bodies and local resource
availabilit y. Despite these limitations, researchers state that the familiar
school setting is beneficial for the deliv ery of psy chiatric -mental health
services, as trust is already established with the school, thereb y promoting a
therapeutic patient -clinician relationships (Gruber at al. , 2021). Notably , the
study emphasiz es that students who identif y as a member of r acial, ethnic,
or sexual minorit y can receiv e the most benefit from SBHCs, making them
particularly beneficial for communities experiencing health service disparities
(Gruber at al. , 2021).
A study conducted b y Williams et al. (2023) highlights the consistent
positiv e impact of School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) on children and
adolescents' mental health. The study discusses concerning trend emerges
among Black adolescent males, who underutiliz e mental health services
compared to other r acial groups, despite a 75% increase in suicide attempts
since 1991 (Williams et al. , 2023). P ersistent psy chosocial and cultur al
barriers (such as stigma, masculine social norms and “self -reliance”) hinder
the utilization of SBHC services for Black teens, despite their a vailabilit y
(Williams et al. , 2023).  Notably , protectiv e factors within schools, such as
teacher support and tr aining, are identified as crucial for impro ving access to
mental health resources for Black adolescent males. In addition to these
socio-cultur al findings, Girio-Herrer a et al. ’s (2019) study further explores
the mental health service disparities among Latino y outh, as this
demogr aphic is also a low utiliz er of mental health services. Their study 
finds that parental acceptance and understanding of mental health needs
among the Latino communit y is lacking, directly affecting their child’ s accessto care (Girio-Herrer a et al. , 2019). Their study also finds that that 50% of
lifetime mental health disorders are identified b y 14 y ears of age, with only
25-50% of adolescents receiving needed services (Girio-Herrer a et al. ,
2019). P arental engagement pro ves critical, with 30% of parents failing to
follow through on care despite high-risk indicators, emphasizing the need for
clear communication and school-based interv entions for vulner able
populations (Girio-Herrer a et al. , 2019).
A study conducted b y Stemphel et al. (2019) rev eals that students with
mental health diagnoses are frequent users of these clinics, with 70% of
SBHCs in Color ado offering psy chiatric -mental health services integr ated into
both their primary care services and social work services. Howev er,
structur al barriers, including the lack of ethnic or r acial representation
among psy chiatric and mental health pro viders for Latino students, pose
challenges to achieving equitable mental health care (Girio-Herrer a, et al. ,
2019). Additionally , Love et al.'s 2019 study rev eals that services at SBHCs
reach 6.3 million students in 10,629 schools. Y outh in impo verished
communities face elev ated r ates of substance use disorders, anxiet y, and
depression (Lo ve et al. , 2019). Despite the reallocation of funding as
Federally Qualified Health Centers and the increased use of telehealth
services in SBHCs, adolescents of color in underserv ed communities still lack
a consistent source of high-qualit y care, highlighting potential disparities in
access based on socioeconomic factors (Lo ve et al. , 2019).

Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
1. Surveys:
Anonymous Surveys for Non-SBHC Stakeholders:  The aim
is to gather insights from school staff , including teachers,
counselors, and administr ative personnel, who are not directly
involved with the SBHCs. The surv ey will assess their knowledge,
attitudes, and referr al practices regarding psy chiatric services. The
survey will include multiple-choice questions, and Lik ert-scale
items. It will focus on the staff 's familiarit y with a vailable services,
and their confidence in referring students for psy chiatric care. The
survey will be distributed electronically through a secure REDCap
page, ensuring anon ymity and confidentialit y for all respondents.
There will be a $15 T arget Gift card incentiv e (funded via
Herrendorf gr ant) to those who participate in the surv ey. To gain
access to the gift card, they will be directed to a link at the end of
the surv ey that will tak e them to another secure REDCap page
unaffiliated with the surv ey it self . There, they will be able to input
their contact information without connecting their surv ey to their
personal information. 
2. Interviews:
De-identified Stakeholder Interviews:  The intent is to
collect in-depth qualitativ e data from k ey stak eholders, including
SBHC staff , school social work ers, and mental health professionals.
These interviews aim to explore their experiences, perceptions,
and challenges related to the pro vision and utilization of
psychiatric services. A semi-structured interviews will be
conducted, allowing participants to elabor ate on specific topics
while ensuring consistency across interviews. Interview questions
will focus on staff ’s attitudes on psy chiatric care and their
confidence in identif ying when an individual could benefit from
care. Interviews data will be de-identified and will be conducted on
a voluntary basis.
3. Observations:
Behavioral Health Team Meetings:  The purpose is to
observ e the dynamics and discussions during Beha vioral Health
Team meetings at the three schools, pro viding context and
understanding of how psy chiatric services are integr ated into the
broader mental health support system. Observ ations will be
conducted in 1-2 meetings per school, with the consent of all
participants. The observ er will focus on an y discussions related to
psychiatric/mental health services, referr al processes, and an y
barriers identified b y the team. No personal or sensitiv e
information unrelated to the qualit y impro vement project will be
recorded. If an y participant does not consent to the observ ation,
the observ ation for that meeting will be forgone entirely .Secondary Research Activities
1. Data Analysis:
Analysis of Existing Records:  To analyz e existing de-
identified data on psy chiatric service with regard to referr al rates,
and service uptak e. The analysis will help identif y patterns and
trends in service utilization, informing the dev elopment of targeted
interv entions to impro ve access and equit y in psy chiatric care.","and Analytical Technique

With this ev aluation project in particular , the K ellogg Logic Model enhances
evaluation methodologies grounded in stak eholder engagement and systems
analysis, which will be substantiated in this project b y way of stak eholder
interviews and surv eys. Through systematic data analysis, the model
enables ev aluations that produce conclusions, identif y resources and
contributions within the SBHCs and affiliated schools, as well as inform
future planning for referr al to psy chiatric services. Importantly , the K ellogg
Logic Model promotes collabor ation and tr ansparency among stak eholders,
facilitating meaningful dialogue and shared understanding of ev aluation
findings."

Inequalities in nature access and en vironmental education among y outh in the United States are
drivers of health and qualit y of life disparities between low -income, non- white y outh, as compared
to their economically -advantaged, white counterparts. Such disparities ha ve the potential to impact
health-related-qualit y-of-life (HRQoL), nature exposure, and en vironmental a wareness, which ha ve
wide-sweeping consequences on both individual dev elopment as well as societal functioning. F or
example, higher HRQoL can lead to lowered risk of chronic diseases later in life, nature exposure
can increase time spent outdoors which promotes greater ph ysical activit y, and increased
environmental a wareness can inspire more en vironmentally -conscious, sustainable beha viors
throughout life. En vironmental education interv entions that place emphasis on nature contact ha ve

The purpose of this research is to ev aluate the use of Photo voice in impro ving STEM-capacit y and
environmental a wareness in Chicago Public School students. P ast research in gener al education and
environmental education has rev ealed Photo voice as a tool to enhance students' learning (Chanse et

EE Interv ention: During 2022 (Spring and F all semesters), a non-profit organization, Gatew ay to the
Great Outdoors (GGO), in partnership with Emory Univ ersity, will administer the EE interv entions to
Chicago Public School District students. The EE interv ention includes both weekly inter active
environmental education in-class lessons and monthly nature-based outings. A team of professionals
with master ’s  or doctor al degrees in education, biology , environmental science, and public health
helped to dev elop the in-class lessons and monthly outings to align with Next Gener ation Science
Standards and the United States En vironmental Protection Agency’ s lesson plans ( “Lesson Plans,
Teacher Guides and Online En vironmental R esources for Educators, ” n.d. ; “Missouri Learning
Standards, ” 2016 ; “Next Gener ation Science Standards: F or States, By States, ” n.d. ; N. Spr ague et
al., 2020 ). Sample learning objectiv es included understanding the differences between composting,
recycling, and tr ash; in vestigating different forms of pollution and remediation techniques; and
comparing and contr asting renew able energy and nonrenew able energy ( N. Spr ague et al. , 2020 ).
The weekly in-class lessons and monthly outings are facilitated b y volunteer undergr aduate mentors
that are tr ained and supervised b y GGO staff and Chicago School District teachers.
Photo voice: The Photo voice interv ention will differ from the tr aditional EE interv ention only in that it
includes a Photo voice activit y. One interv ention class of students will be assigned to a Photo voice
interv ention group . During the second class of the interv ention, students participating in the
Photo voice interv ention will receiv e disposable camer as and ha ve a 60-min lesson on how to
properly use disposable camer as and how to tak e photogr aphs with participant consent. These
students will then be instructed to tak e photogr aphs on their own that represent their en vironment
for the next week. During the third class, the disposable camer as will be collected, and the students
will participate in the lesson plan designated for week 2. The photos from the disposable camer as
will be dev eloped and brought to the classroom for the 4th week of the interv ention. T welve trained
research assistants will hold focus groups of two to four students to discuss the photos that
represent the en vironment. The research assistants will instruct the y outh to tell a story about a
handful of their photogr aphs. The interviewer will ha ve the participant select the photogr aph that
was most meaningful for him/her to discuss. The interviewer will ask a series of predetermined
questions about the selected photo . These are the questions the SHOWED method: Predetermined

Research Activities and Treatment Conditions:
The GGO program is currently being implemented in John B. Drake Elementary School and
John Fiske Elementary School. GGO is currently providing programming for one fourth
grade classroom at Drake, one sixth grade classroom at Fiske, and sixth/seventh mixed
grade classroom at Fiske. The GGO program takes place once a week during classroom
science time.
There are currently 63 students participating in the GGO program. Thus, we plan for about
100 students to participate in the study to account for the control group. We hope to
expand to more classrooms in our partner schools for the 2022-2023 school year, to threegrades in Fiske and three grades in Drake. Participants of the study will be non-randomly
assigned to a Photovoice intervention, a traditional intervention, or a control group based
on their school and classroom. School administrators and teachers will select which
classrooms participate in the intervention. Control groups will be selected within the
same school in order to match socio-economic and racial demographics of the
intervention group. Students in the traditional intervention will participate in the GGO
program normally. The experience for students in the Photovoice intervention will differ
from the traditional intervention only in that they will also participate in a Photovoice
activity. The control group will not participate in the intervention (the GGO program). We
will recruit control group members from neighboring schools and within Fiske and Drake.
The control group from neighboring schools will be a school to whom we can provide our
intervention in subsequent years.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical techniques that will
be utilized as part of this study.
For Photo voice: The Photo voice interview tr anscripts will be analyz ed using Br aun and Clark e’s six-
step method of qualitativ e analysis ( Braun & Clark e, 2006 ). Briefly , these six steps are that the
reviewers (1) familiariz e themselv es with data, (2) dev elop preliminary codes, (3) search for themes
within the preliminary code, (4) ev aluate potential themes, (5) label and defined themes, and (6)
develop a final report ( Braun & Clark e, 2006 ). We will first ha ve four tr ained reviewers conduct a
preliminary analysis to familiariz e themselv es with the Photo voice focus group tr anscripts.
Individually , the reviewers will dev elop potential thematic codes for the tr anscripts. Then, the four
reviewers will collabor atively ev aluate the proposed themes and dev elop the official themes. A fifth
reviewer , who purposefully will not attend the meeting, will revise and appro ve the final set of
themes. T wo independent reviewers will coded each theme for ev ery tr anscript. The agreement
between the two independent reviewers’ sets of codes will be determined through the K appa
statistic. Briefly , scores r ange from −1.0 to 1.0, where −1.0 indicates complete disagreement and
1.0 indicates complete agreement ( Hallgren, 2012 ). Landis and K och suggest that scores of 0.61–
0.80 represent substantial agreement and scores 0.81–1.0 represent strong agreement ( Landis &
Koch, 1977 ).
For the questionnaire: W e will calculate the pre-interv ention and post -interv ention prev alence of
environmental a wareness for the Photo voice interv ention group , the tr aditional interv ention group ,
and the control group . We will then run two-proportion Z tests to analyz e significant differences in
the prev alence of en vironmental a wareness. All statistical analyses for the questionnaire analysis
will be performed in R and RStudio ."

The proposed project is to adapt Amir a – the first AI -powered K -6 intelligent reading tutor – to
support low -literate adolescents (g. 7-12) in becoming motiv ated and masterful readers,
through a student -led and student -centered co-design process.  
 
Amira is an accur ate, AI -powered reading assistant that listens to and supports students as
they read aloud, serving 2 million elementary students across 800+ districts.  Amir a has
demonstr ated efficacy , with published studies showing it helps students impro ve fluency on-par
with students working with certified human tutors. The a vatar adjusts her instructional supports
based on the observ ed strengths, needs and personal char acteristics of each learner to select
the best possible interv ention for a particular child in each moment. 
CPS has an existing Master Services and Data Sharing Agreement for Educational T echnology
Products and Services to use Amir a Learning (distributed through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
Publishing Compan y).  
Amira Learning will work with Chicago Public Schools (in addition to R ocky Mountain Prep , a
charter network in Color ado) during school y ear 2024-2025 to engage a small group of
students (gr ades 7-12) in using Amir a and pro viding feedback through user -based design focus
groups to adapt the tool to work with secondary school students. The research team will
conduct up to 7 research-based design sprints (each sprint lasting appro ximately 3-4 weeks) to
elicit feedback and mak e relev ant changes to the existing Amir a Learning offering for K -6 to
drive gains in foundational reading skills for older students.  Secondary students will use Amir a
in classrooms, then a subgroup of those student users will pro vide feedback about their
experience reading with Amir a through up to 7 student -centered focus groups.  W e anticipate a
total of 50 CPS secondary students will participate in one or more of the focus groups.  W e will
also gather feedback through interviews with up to 10 teachers regarding use of Amir a in their
secondary school classrooms.  De-identified Amir a platform data, along with student focus
group input and teacher interview responses will be used to shape informed h ypotheses
regarding potent adaptations to the softw are for use b y low-literacy secondary students and
teachers.  Collabor ative designs of new or adapted features to driv e usage and engagement
with Amir a will be incorpor ated into the softw are by Amir a engineers, made a vailable to CPS 7-
12 gr ade students and further studied in iter ative cycles to inform further revisions.  The
project will enable Amir a to morph into a “fits right in” intelligent reading assistant for
secondary students and their teachers.
 
Areas of focus for feedback from the focus groups and teacher interviews ma y include: changes
to the student/tutor inter action, such as more inter active comprehension interv entions that
would be more appropriate for older readers; changes to the Amir a avatar to be more
appealing for secondary students; adding more age- appropriate reading content (High
Engagement / Low Complexit y or 'Hi-Lo' stories); and creating dev elopmentally appropriate
approaches within the softw are to driv e engagement with Amir a and increase motiv ation for
older students to pr actice reading more regularly .  
 
The project team at Amir a will elicit student and teacher feedback on what changes to the
softw are would be most impactful to driv e engagement and impact for older students.  Analysis
for the project will include understanding aggregate usage, engagement, and impact data from
student use of Amir a, and analysis of responses from appro ximately 7 focus group sessions
with small groups of MS/HS students (appro ximately 50 total students), and interviews with up
to 10 teachers (appro ximately 2 interviews each x 45-minutes). 
 
The work will be funded through a gr ant from the Learning Econom y Foundation. 
 
Phase 1 of this project will occur between F all 2024 through Summer 2025. Upon completion of
appro ximately 7 r apid R&D cy cles, including dev elopment of new features and functionalit y, the
team will share results of the new and impro ved version of Amir a with participating CPS
students and teachers so they can see direct w ays their feedback and suggestions are
incorpor ated into changes in the softw are.  A final written report, summarizing the results of
the project, will be submitted into CPS' IRBManager , in compliance with the District
requirements. 
 
In a follow -on Phase 2 of work during SY 2025-2026 (under a new , future IRB -appro vedapplication) we will work with an external research partner to conduct formal efficacy research
and share findings with the field about the impact of Amir a for Older Students on student
growth in reading.  The lik ely external research partner for this future phase (lik ely SY2025-
2026) is the Univ ersity of Chicago EdLabs.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Q1.)  DESIGN: What changes need to be made to the a vatar and visual experience with Amir a
for secondary students? 
     Hypothesis 1:  Students ma y want an a vatar reading buddy of a different age, with the
ability to customiz e clothing and ph ysical features.  Secondary students ma y also w ant to
choose from different backgrounds, more so than y ounger students. 
 
Q2.) CONTENT : What t ypes of stories will secondary students w ant to read with Amir a? 
      Hypothesis 2:  Students will w ant a mix of fiction content, non-fiction content, and pr actical
content about jobs and careers. 
 
Q3.) STUDENT INTERVENTIONS / TUT OR INTERACTIONS: W ould secondary students feel safe
(vs. embarr assed) reading with Amir a?
       Hypothesis 3:  Students will feel comfortable reading with an a vatar (esp . if designed to fit
their preferences from Q1 abo ve).  There ma y be some students who w ant more support and
others who w ant less interv ention as they read.  W e hypothesiz e a need and a desire for more
emphasis on comprehension, as opposed to foundational phonics skills.
 
Q4.). MO TIVATION: What would mak e a secondary student who ma y not w ant to read with
Amira or ma y not be v ery good at reading aloud, pr actice reading with Amir a?
       Hypothesis 4:  There ma y be a mix of in- app rew ards (customiz e the a vatar) and out -of-
app rew ards (gift certificates, scholarship money , class parties, etc.).  There ma y be a big gap
from 7th gr ade to 12th gr ade, which will differ in some meaningful w ays from elementary
students.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is the
contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body of extant

Although most U .S adults ha ve basic liter acy skills, more than half (54%) are unable to read
above a sixth-gr ade lev el (Walker, 2008).  P ost-COVID , 64% of US 8th gr aders read below
grade lev el – particularly students who are historically marginaliz ed.  Student motiv ation,
teacher skills in teaching reading, br ain plasticit y, and other factors mak e the gap for struggling
older readers particularly hard to close.  Middle and high school teachers need tools designed to
support learning v ariabilit y focused on reading fluency and comprehension.
Product rev amping will target both the interfaces between teachers and Amir a and students
and Amir a.
The goal of the classroom research will be to encour age teachers and students to share their
experiences with Amir a in as unconstr ained a manner as possible to unco ver the most
important factors driving their experiences. Nonetheless, the interview and focus group
questions will be guided b y a theoretical approach to explaining teacher and student
motiv ations that has a strong foundation in the research liter ature: the expectancy -value
theory (EVT). Originally proposed b y Eccles et al. (1983) to explain student motiv ation and
adapted specifically for teachers b y Watt & Richardson (2007), EVT has been applied in
numerous research studies to explain teachers’ use of technology in the classroom (Cheng
et.al., 2020). The theory explains both teacher and student decisions (in this case, to engage
with Amir a) based on factors that fall into two categories: expectation of success and subjectiv e
task v alue.
Teachers’ expectation of success will be explored with respect to: (a) their beliefs about their
own internal competence at integr ating technology into their classroom (V ongkulluksn, et al. ,
2018; Ertmer & Ottenbreit -Leftwich, 2010; Inan & Lowther , 2010); (b) their beliefs about the
extent to which technology will help them to achiev e their goals for teaching and learning (  
Ottenbreit -Leftwich et al. , 2010); and (c) their beliefs about external factors that will affect
their success, such as the a vailabilit y of administr ator and tech support when needed (Cheng
et.al., 2020). Evidence indicates that internal sense of competence is the most predictiv e of
technology use (Ottenbreit -Leftwich et al. , 2015; Kim et al. , 2013), and thus targeting teacher
competency beliefs and pro viding support for success will be a high priorit y. But since external
factors ma y be more easily changed, we will also consider new features of Amir a to increase its
value to administr ators with a goal of increasing administr ators’ activ e support for Amir a.
Teachers’ subjectiv e task v alue will be explored with respect to: (a) their perceiv ed value of
Amira’s capacit y to acceler ate students' learning (Ottenbreit -Leftwich et al. , 2010); (b) the cost
in terms of additional time and effort required b y the teacher of using Amir a (Cheng et al. ,
2020); (c) the potential of Amir a to solv e a problem for the teacher (Ack erman et al. , 2001;
Wozney et al. , 2006), such as k eeping students working productiv ely so the teacher has
uninterrupted time with small groups (Ba ylor & Ritchie, 2002); and (d) the ev aluation of the
teacher based on or related to their use of Amir a (Mumtaz, 2000; K afyulilo et al. , 2016).
The same two EVT dimensions will be considered with respect to students. First, students'
expectations of success, the importance of which is lik ely to increase across the gr ades K -5 as
students become more a ware and concerned about success relativ e to peers than students at
the younger end of the spectrum. Second, students’ subjectiv e task v alue, which will be
explored both in interview questions and informed b y observ ations of students’ engagement
level with Amir a. In particular , we will explore the extent to which students subjectiv e task
value ma y be influenced b y: (a) delight, related to the content of the reading; (Jenkins, 2006),
the beha vior of Amir a avatar (F alloon, 2010), and the aesthetic appeal of the screen (Thüring &
Mahlk e, 2007); (b) choice that is meaningful (Moller et al. , 2006; P atall et al. , 2008, 2010); (c)
opportunit y for social inter action with other students (Duk e & Pearson, 2002; Fisher & Frey ,
2008; P earson & Fielding, 1991); and (d) abilit y to see concrete evidence of their own
impro vement with Amir a use (Bangert -Drowns et al. , 1991; Black & William, 1998; Gr aham et
al., 2015; Kingston & Nash, 2011).","and Student/Staff Involvement

research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
As noted abo ve, the team will elicit feedback from secondary students who are struggling with
reading/liter acy and their teachers to mak e relev ant changes to the existing Amir a Learning
offering for K -6 to driv e gains in foundational reading skills for older students.  Secondary
students will use Amir a in classrooms, then a subgroup of those student users will pro vide
feedback about their experience reading with Amir a through up to 7 student -centered focus
groups, each lasting about 45-minutes.  W e anticipate a total of 50 CPS secondary students will
participate in one or more of the 7 focus groups. 
We will also gather feedback through interviews with up to 10 teachers regarding use of Amir a
in their secondary school classrooms. Appro ximately 2 interviews with each teacher x 10
teachers x 30-45 minutes per interview . 
De-identified Amir a platform data (e.g. , weekly usage patterns, which stories are most read or
most skipped, etc.), along with student focus group input and teacher interview responses will
be used to shape informed h ypotheses regarding potent adaptations, and adaptations of the
softw are for use b y low-literacy secondary students and teachers.  Collabor ative designs of new

engineers, implemented and then further studied in iter ative cycles to inform further revisions.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical techniques that
will be utilized as part of this study.
The R&D project will be ex ecuted in multiple “ Analyz e, Design and Dev elop, Implement,
Evaluate and Adjust ” (ADIE) r apid learning cy cles. Each cy cle in volves an iter ative process,
combining tech-enabled interv ention and data gathering through focus groups / interviews, to
inform decisions about which impro vements in underlying features, designs, or content
presentation within Amir a will most significantly enhance classroom-readiness of the tool for
low-literate secondary students.
Each r apid learning cy cle will focus on one or more product adaptations within a particular
aspect of Amir a (avatar, content, etc.). The cy cles will include (a) analyz e, (b) Design and
Develop, (c) Implement, and (d) Ev aluate and Adjust.  The focus of each change is on what
changes could we mak e that will result in impro vement in engagement (increased usage of at
least 30 minutes per week) to acceler ate reading mastery for secondary students. T eachers will
be interviewed for appro ximately 30-45 minutes, outside of their normal duties. Student co-
design focus groups will be appro ximately 45-minutes, as well. Information collected
automatically through Amir a will also enhance decisions regarding areas for deeper explor ation
during interviews and focus groups."

The Illinois Department of Public Health is collabor ating with the Univ ersity of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) to conduct the Illinois Y outh T obacco Surv ey (IL YTS), a
research project designed to collect information about tobacco usage among students
in grades 6 through 12. The IL YTS will be instrumental in pro viding comprehensiv e data
and insights regarding y outh tobacco use, including trends, prev alence r ates, and
factors influencing initiation and continued use. By tr acking these metrics, the surv ey
will enable policymak ers, health care professionals, educators, and other stak eholders
to mak e informed decisions and to implement evidence-based interv entions.
The surv ey is entirely online and designed for students in gr ades 6 through 12. The
survey is anon ymous and confidential, ensuring the priv acy of both students and the
school. The surv ey co vers various aspects of tobacco and e-cigarette usage, from trying
tobacco or v aping products to reasons for usage, different resources for obtaining these
products, and sources of information. The surv ey will also include a brief asthma
module to assess tobacco use among students with asthma.
The sample includes 75 middle schools r andomly selected from the 1203 schools from
ISBE's public list (including schools that are a part of the 2024 sample) and 75 high
schools r andomly selected from the 730 schools from ISBE's public list (including
schools that are a part of the 2024 sample).
Given the persistent threat posed b y tobacco use to the health and well-being of our
youth, along with the Illinois Y outh T obacco Surv ey not ha ving been conducted since
2015, this project will help identif y how the landscape of y outh tobacco use has
changed since the past decade.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
N/A","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What
is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the
body of extant knowledge?
The study of y outh tobacco use has ev olved significantly o ver the past decades,
primarily due to rising public health concerns about the early onset of tobacco addiction
and its long-term health consequences. The Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention
(CDC) initiated v arious surv eys to monitor tobacco use among y outh, including the
National Y outh T obacco Surv ey (NYT S), which serv es as a model for state-lev el surv eys
like the YT S. There is an increasing recognition of the harmful effects of v arious tobacco
products, including tr aditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and emerging products lik e
nicotine pouches.
The YT S builds upon and complements the existing body of knowledge from v arious
significant studies and surv eys. The surv ey contributes state-specific data that can be
compared with national trends found in the NYT S to identif y unique regional issues and
inform tailored interv entions. It can also compare with research at the state-lev el,
identif ying intak e and susceptibilit y trends within Illinois, aiding in the prediction and
prevention of future increases in e-cigarette use. By building on national research and
contributing unique state-specific data, the YT S informs local public health initiativ es
and supports broader efforts to reduce y outh tobacco use and its associated health
risks.","and Student/Staff Involvement

Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
The YT S research methodology is designed to gather comprehensiv e data on tobacco
use among middle and high school students. This methodology encompasses sev eral
stages, from sample selection and data collection to data processing and analysis.
Research Methodology
1. Sampling Design
Target P opulation: Students in gr ades six through twelv e from Illinois public and
private schools.
Sampling Fr ame: A comprehensiv e list of all middle and high schools in Illinois.
Sampling Method:
A stratified r andom sampling approach ensures representation across
various demogr aphics and regions.
School Selection: 75 middle schools and 75 high schools are r andomly
selected.
Student Selection: Within each school, classes are r andomly chosen to
participate, ensuring a representativ e sample of students.
2. Recruitment and Consent
School R ecruitment: School administr ators are contacted via email and phone to
gain permission for surv ey administr ation.
Parental Consent: Online consent from parents or guardians is obtained through
the school, with information on the surv ey’s purpose and procedures.
Student Assent: Students pro vide assent to participate, acknowledging their
understanding and v oluntary participation.
3. Survey Administration
Modes of Administr ation:
Virtual In-Class: Conducted during a designated class period using school
computers or students' personal devices.
Asynchronous: A surv ey link is pro vided for students to complete the
survey at their con venience.
Survey Dur ation: Appro ximately 45 minutes.
Confidentialit y: Students' responses are anon ymous and automatically stored in
REDCap to protect their priv acy.
Survey administr ation can occur in two formats: synchronous or asynchronous.
Synchronous Surv ey Administr ation: This option tak es place during the selected class
period per gr ade lev el, with each consenting student participating in the surv ey at the
same time under supervision. It ensures all students complete the surv ey
simultaneously and in a controlled en vironment. This method is useful for schools that
prefer structured participation during school hours.
Asynchronous Surv ey Administr ation: This option is more flexible and allows students
to tak e the surv ey outside of class time, t ypically o ver the course of a week. Schools
distribute surv ey links to students in the selected classes, and students complete the
survey independently at their own con venience. This approach is ideal for schools that
do not wish to interfere with instructional time or prefer to minimiz e in-class
disruptions.
Determining the F ormat: The decision to administer the surv ey synchronously or
asynchronously is determined b y the school. Schools that prioritiz e preserving
instructional time ma y opt for the asynchronous format, while those that prefer a morestructured en vironment ma y choose the synchronous option.
Does the Surv ey Need to Be Administered During Class Time? If the synchronous option
is chosen, y es, the surv ey would tak e place during one class period per gr ade lev el.
Howev er, if the school opts for the asynchronous method, students can complete the
survey outside of class time to not interfere with instructional time.
Alternativ e Activit y for Non-Consented Students: F or non-consented students who are
not participating in the surv ey during synchronous administr ation, an alternativ e
activit y should be pro vided at the teacher ’s discretion. This ma y include independent
reading, quiet study , or other non-disruptiv e educational activities that align with the
school's policies. The goal is to ensure that non-consenting students remain engaged
during the class period without interrupting the surv ey process.
Analytical Techniques
1. Data Processing
Data Cleaning: R emoving incomplete or inconsistent responses, ensuring data
accur acy.
Coding: Con verting surv ey responses into numerical codes for analysis.
2. Descriptive Statistics
Frequency Distributions: T o understand the prev alence of tobacco use and
distribution of responses.
Measures of Centr al Tendency and V ariabilit y: Mean, median, mode, standard
deviation to describe data char acteristics.
3. Inferential Statistics
Cross- Tabulation: T o explore relationships between different v ariables (e.g. ,
tobacco use and demogr aphic factors).
Chi-Square T ests: T o test for significant associations between categorical
variables.
t-Tests and ANOV A: To compare means across different groups (e.g. , comparing
usage r ates between different gr ades or genders).
4. Trend Analysis
Longitudinal Analysis: Comparing data across different surv ey periods to
identif y trends o ver time.
Regression Analysis: T o predict factors influencing tobacco use, accounting for
multiple v ariables.
5. Multivariate Analysis
Logistic R egression: T o examine the lik elihood of tobacco use based on v arious
predictors (e.g. , peer influence, exposure to adv ertising).
Factor Analysis: T o identif y underlying factors that explain patterns in surv ey
responses.
6. Geographic Analysis
GIS Mapping: T o visualiz e the geogr aphic distribution of tobacco use across
Illinois, identif ying potential regional patterns."

How do teacher-artist partners experience inquiry into pandemic-related adjustments
and how does this inquiry inform perceived agency?","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject.
What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build
upon the body of extant knowledge?
Arts integr ation creates disturbances to normativ e educational pr actices with the
introduction of a teaching artist. In CAPE partnerships, teaching artists mediate the
curricula design, the conceptual and material tools used in learning processes, and
shift purposes bey ond standardiz ed tests and narrow forms of knowledge. Arts
integr ation can create gener ative disturbances to normativ e classroom activities
especially related to rules, roles, and culture (Preston & Diaz, 2020; Preston &
Spilberg, 2020). Activit y theory offers analytic tools to understand interrelated
components within social activit y, and in the context of remote and h ybrid learning
for CAPE partnerships, there were multiple disturbances to norms. The most visible
mediational components of learning activities are how people use tools to accomplish
emergent purposes (Engeström, 2008). The less visible components of social
mediation are the rules, roles, and culture that shape activit y (Engeström, 2008). In
pandemic learning, the gener ative potential of arts integr ation w as compounded as
partners na vigated how to adjust their work within technological systems across
physical space. The deepest disturbance of remote learning w as that computer
technology mediated all activit y, which meant ev ery inter action w as dually shaped b y
ruptures between school/home, presence/absence, and formal/ev eryday.
Disturbances can mak e contr adictions within normativ e systems more visible,
creating opportunities to reexamine purposes (Sannino et al. , 2016). With
unprecedented departure from regular classroom activit y, the partners had the
opportunit y to better understand the system within which they work ed, ev en as the
system itself w as changing (Engeström, 2008). When inner contr adictions are made
visible, opportunities for adjustments can be gener ative and lead to expansiv e
transitions (Engeström, 2008; Preston & Diaz, 2020; Sannino et al. , 2016). 
Sannino et al. (2016) define expansiv e learning as a process where people
“reconceptualiz e and pr actically tr ansform the object of their activit y to face its
unsustainable historically formed contr adictions” (p . 624). Berry (2020) asserted that
the COVID-19 pandemic created an opening to tr ansform public education based on
care of the whole child and integr ating communication and supports within
communities. The disruptions to normativ e activit y, such as mandated curriculum
and standardiz ed tests, made it possible for change from the bottom up (Berry ,
2020). During and after the initial crisis period of the pandemic, the “normal scripted
course of ev ents in the work process” w as no longer possible (Engeström, 2008, p .
24). The systemic disturbances required restructuring the means and purposes of
activit y, thus creating an opportunit y to understand the oppressiv e nature of
structures and construct new pr actices as a means of persev ering.
Within a system, such as a classroom, structures can be considered the norms
governing activit y. Sewell (1992) defined structures as ""sets of mutually sustaining
schemas and resources that empower and constr ain social action and that tend to be
reproduced b y that social action” (p . 19). Historically , norms in education ha ve been
inequitable and not inclusiv e (Paris, 2012; Spring, 2013). Individuals are shaped b y
structures and maintain or challenge them in action (Sewell, 1992). The concept of
agency is a person's abilit y to redefine and reimagine themselv es within an
environment b y finding connections and solutions that were not necessarily
supported b y current norms (V arelas, Settlage, & Mensah, 2015, p . 439).
Challenging norms can facilitate agency in a person's abilit y to dev elop new pr actices
and use their resources across learning contexts (V arelas, Settlage, & Mensah,
2015); in this w ay, agency can allow one to reimagine their identit y as a teacher or
student. F or example, in a study of adolescents during the pandemic, Barma and
Ste-Marie (2021) found that disrupted boundaries between homes and schoolscreated opportunities to cultiv ate interpersonal relationships as protection against
isolation and demotiv ation through mentorship and to pro vide technical and
environmental support for learning. The restructuring of remote and h ybrid
configur ations disrupted norms b y redefining the boundaries. Norms in student -
teacher inter actions were challenged, and this pro vided structur al affordances to
facilitate agency . These changes can ha ve consequential spatial implications for
relations.
Spatial and Script Slippage: A ttunement
Space is continually produced within social pr actices and formed b y knowledge and
action (Lefebrv e, 1991; Massey , 2005). What knowledge is v alued is political and
mediates both material and social inter actions (Lefebrv e 1991, p . 9). A critical aspect
of spatial tr ansformation is the possibilit y of disrupting pr actices, specifically , those
that dev alue sensorial and emotional knowledge, divide the mental and social, and
oppress the knowledge and actions of people through hegemonic structures. Space
can be difficult to understand because it is the in visible organizational structure of
social activit y. Spatial pr actices are the coherent performances of activit y. There are
implicit societal expectations within each space regarding acceptable actions and
what knowledge is considered competent. P erformances of spatial pr actices can be
understood as a bridge to scripts. Gutiérrez, Rh ymes, and Larsen (1995) described
scripts as the patterns of inter action that shape participation and interpretation of
activit y. Scripts guide how one is “supposed” to talk and who they are “supposed” to
be in specific spaces. Gutiérrez et al. (1995) found monologic teacher scripts can
create a space that limits the knowledge and identities that count in the space. Thus,
departures from normativ e scripts can create the space to disrupt inequitable power
and relations. The possibilit y of agency is alw ays present because learning and
relational potentials can expand when norms are not maintained and reified in
action. 
Small agentic gestures and actions can challenge scripts and shift collectiv e activit y
toward students’ ideas, v alues, and inquiries (Da vis, V ossoughi, & Smith, 2020).
These are agentic moments of script slippage , where teacher and student
interactions are unconstr ained b y hier archy and ev aluation, adult -centered v alues,
and predetermined outcomes. Space can be co-created, reimagined, and
restructured when power and relations shift. In research on CAPE after school
progr amming, Preston and Spilberg (2020) found that agency and space were
intertwined because students came to conceiv e of “space as built from and inclusiv e
of their emotional, social, and cognitiv e selv es—at once both their responsibilit y to
continually recreate and a space to which they belong. ” In the context of remote and
hybrid learning, structures immediately tr ansformed along with the potential for
spaces and related identities to be (re)defined and disrupted through agentic
possibilit y.
According to Shotter (2015), the common, professional w ay of thinking oper ates in a
disengaged logic where content is separ ate from individual and contextual meanings.
The script of such inter actions follows a monologic model, where a teacher holds a
predetermined understanding that they guide students tow ard. Becoming dialogical
requires accepting what w as nev er fully understood and thinking with others
(Shotter , 2015). Mo ving from normativ e scripts requires a departure from diagnostic
and hier archal relations, where teachers assess and assimilate students’ knowledge
into what teachers already know . Rather, teachers attune to students to become
more fully present in the learning process (Shotter , 2015). In fact, Kr aehe (2020)
argues that collabor ation is centr al to an educator ’s abilit y to adapt art curriculum in
remote spaces b y helping teachers embr ace uncertaint y and “teach tow ard the
unknown” (p . 5). Shotter (2015) described this as an ontological and axiological
shift:Rather than as external agents wholly in control of the unfolding processes of
importance to us, we need to see ourselv es as being internally related to still-in-
process, flowing “worlds” of intermingling activities, activities which, as they flow
through us, influence us as much, if not more, than we can influence them . (p. 9) 
Disrupting scripts requires understanding how our actions are structured b y the
dynamic relations we ha ve with each other and our broader surroundings. 
This conceptual fr amework combines activit y and spatial theories with concepts of
agency and scripts to explore how disturbances to activit y can create gener ative
opportunities to reconceptualiz e learning structures. T eacher -artist partners were
forced into forming their spatial pr actices anew in the pandemic context and they are
continuing to mak e sense of these adjustments as they struggle with continued
disruptions such as shifts to quarentining and implications of remote learning and the
broader pandemic. Through a descriptiv e and interpretiv e study of CAPE
partnerships, the researchers will explore partners centr al concerns in this context
related to tools and participation and the implications of their adjustments on space
and agency .","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated
with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that
will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations,
etc.)
There will be up to 5 CPS teachers in volved in this study and up to 100 students
involved in the student prompt activit y. The following are the data sources that
involve CPS teachers with descriptions of teacher in volvement.
Professional Development Observations.  Professional dev elopment sessions that
are conducted for all A/RP teachers and teaching artists as part of their regular
activit y will be documented with field notes and artifacts will be documented with b y
collecting digital copies of presentation and powerpoint materials. Blurring and
obscuring of identif ying information (e.g. names or faces) will be completed using
photo-editing in iPhoto , preview , and P owerP oint. Field notes will attend to
connections between concepts of agency and space with what participants share
about their own experiences. The research component is optional and only consented
individuals will ha ve data collected about their participation.
Digital Portfolios.  As part of their participation in CAPE progr ams, teacher -artist
partners pro vide written reflections and accounts of their implementation of the arts-
integr ation project. This documentation is publically a vailable and t ypically includes
short descriptions of their arts-integr ation project accompanied b y student work. An y
student work or artifacts included on the digital portfolios will not be used for this
research. T eacher -artist partner ’s commentary , description, and reflections about
their curriculum and instruction will be collected as data. T eacher -artist partners
upload the reflections to the online publishing platform of Google Sites. The digital
portfolios are part of regular professional dev elopment, are publicly a vailable, and
SOPP A appro ved via CPS . The digital portfolios and their accompan ying commentary
will pro vide a data source to gather information about how participant thinking has
evolved, how they experienced collabor ation, and other areas related to professional
development goals. All participants and content will be de-identified per consent
agreements.
Interviews. Interviews will broadly attend to ideas of agency and space. The
interview will be conducted b y a researcher with y oked pairs (or a single teacher or
teaching artist if both partners do not consent and an un yoked individual is enrolled)
and will be semi-structured to be responsiv e to what is shared, conducted o ver
zoom, will be appro ximately one hour long, and will be audio-recorded then
transcribed b y Zoom softw are progr am or TEMI then edited and revised b y the PI.
Space Prompts. Teacher -artist partners will complete digital Space Prompts. There
will be four prompts that ask them to depict 1) the remembered classroom space, 2)
their experience in remote/h ybrid learning, 3) how they perceiv e the current
classroom space, and 4) what their imagined classroom space would look lik e. The
prompts will each ha ve a visual and textual field. The prompts will be in Google
Jamboard.
Research Review Session Interview.  A review session with between 4-6 CAPE
teacher -artist partners and up to 6 CAPE staff will include discussion on emergent
themes in analysis to explore, challenge, and codif y findings. Emergent themes will
ground discussion in specific ideas which will allow individual perspectiv es to be
uncovered and discussed. Themes will be written in a short document and shared to
guide discussion tow ard deepening and/or challenging ideas. After each partner
shares their thoughts, I will ask specific follow up questions or in vite dialogue across
participants. Then, I ask the other focal participants and staff members if they ha ve
any comments or connections. After all partners ha ve shared, I will ask group-lev elquestions in relation to the core themes.  The review session will be audio-recorded
and tr anscribed via Z oom's softw are progr am or TEMI then edited and revised b y the
PI.
Chronology of Activities:
September – April: IRB and RRB submissions and appro val
September-June: Professional Dev elopment
February - April: Partnership Con venings
Up to two meetings with 3-5 teaching artists will be conducted with the researcher
and CAPE staff to pro vide space for discussion and to gather more nuanced data
about curricular adjustments after professional dev elopment sessions based on what
has been learned about agency and space the specific needs, interest, and qualities
of their students.
March - June: Interviews, Space Prompts, and Digital Portfolios
•     Space Prompts will be completed before interviews.
•     P artnership Interviews will be conducted after partners ha ve
implemented their projects.
•     P artners create their digital portfolios as part of their regular professional
development participation after implementation.
April - July: Initial Data Analysis and R esearch R eview Session.
July – August: Data Analysis and R eport. 
The final research report will be first shared with the participants for member
checking and then with CAPE Staff . The researcher and CAPE staff will ha ve a
meeting to discuss the findings and implications for progr amming. This report will be
shared with the Dept. of Arts Ed. at CPS .","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
This descriptiv e and interpretiv e collectiv e case study aims to understand teacher -
artist partners as a culture sharing group b y closely exploring how they co-design
and implement curriculum based on what w as learned since school building closures
(Creswell & P oth, 2018; Stak e, 2000). A case study methodology will allow me to
bound teacher -artist partners and illuminate how they na vigate tensions and
potentials created b y the disruptions to norms within the timefr ame of their 2021-
2022 partnership . By bounding each case using Erickson’ s (1986) concept of “micro
culture, ” deep understanding of phenomena can emerge from “regularly inter acting
groups of individuals as meanings come to be shared and patterns of action and
interaction dev elop” (Moss & Haertel, 2016, p . 34). A descriptiv e and interpretiv e
focus is appropriate because I aim to capture the “immediate and local meanings of
actions, as defined from the actors’ point of view” (Erickson, 1986, p . 120) and
dually shaped in the specific context of continued pandemic learning and schooling
norms. Further , a case study methodology will enable prolonged engagement to
progressiv ely focus using data collection and analysis to clarif y preconceptions and
confusion and capture ev olutions in thinking (Charmaz, 2014; Creswell & P oth,
2018). The purposiv e selection of v eteran teacher -artist partners will pro vide me the
best lik elihood of learning about themes because v eterans are not simultaneously
grappling with challenges that are inherent in early stage partnerships (Moss &
Haertel, 2016; Stak e, 2000). The participatory approach to the case study
methodology will adv ance knowledge and build theory with participants on tensions
and potentials for agency b y incorpor ating local knowledge and engagement with
literature in ""all phases of the research” (Str auss & Corbin, 1990).
      Case study research is built from extensiv e data collection and multiple data
sources (Creswell & P oth, 2018). This study includes a wide r ange of data sources to
provide multiple w ays to explore emergent themes and afford me the abilit y to
conduct theoretical sampling to sharpen themes throughout remote data collection
and analysis (Charmaz, 2014).
Data Analysis Plans
Tools from constructivist grounded theory will be combined with case methods in
data collection and analysis to gain an endogenous understanding of adapted
practices (Charmaz, 2014). The first pass of coding will be open-ended and used
sensitizing concepts (Charmaz, 2014) related to 1) adjustments due to the
remote/h ybrid and pandemic context, 2) interpretation agency within which partners
worked and designed into their curriculum, and 3) descriptions of the implications of
these adjustments. Data analysis will in volve staying close to the data using in- vivo
coding and gerunds to triangulate themes within each case before analyzing
compar atively (Flyvberg, 2006; Stak e, 2000). Analytic memos will be used
throughout data collection and coding as part of identif ying patterns, sharpening
categories and processes guiding further data collection and analysis. (Charmaz,
2014). The second coding pass will identif y and describe initial codes with higher
frequency and strongly relate to the larger context (Charmaz, 2014; Creswell & P oth,
2018). Emergent findings will then be shared with participants and the ideas within it
will be discussed in the review session as part of theoretical sampling (Charmaz,
2014). This approach embr aces the research as a shared construction because it
is ""sees both data and analysis as created from shared experiences and relationships
with participants and other sources of data"" (Charmaz, 2014, p . 239). The review
session will ground initial findings in participants’ perspectiv es and pro vide an
opportunit y to elabor ate or challenge ideas. The third coding pass will incorpor ate the
review session tr anscript and aim to crystaliz e themes, clarif y ideas, isolate
“noteworth y quotes” to capture an analytic theme, and apply theoretical coding(Charmaz, 2014; Creswell & P oth, 2017, p . 194). The fourth pass will identif y
relationships between the themes using memos and theoretical coding (Creswell &
Poth, 2018)."

when, where, duration, frequency, and with whom.
Interviews with T utor Corps site coordinators: Interviews for T utor Corps site
coordinators (people designated b y their school leader as o verseeing the T utor Corps
progr am) will tak e place virtually each spring with site coordinators in up to 45
participating schools. The interview will focus on understanding how implementation of
the model is rolling out at each school, including challenges faced and lessons learned.
These interviews will also focus on the systems and resources that the school put in
place to set up the progr am (e.g. scheduling; student selection), including challenges
and lessons learned. The interview will also seek to identif y other k ey elements of
school context that ma y have influenced implementation and other t ypes of
personaliz ed learning and supplemental support services a vailable to students at the
school. Each interview will last up to 60 minutes. P articipants will be offered a $60 gift
card as a thank y ou and in recognition of their time.
Interviews with teachers: The research team will conduct 30 minute virtual interviews
with v olunteering teachers of students participating in up to 45 sampled schools
participating in the T utor Corps initiativ e and the PLI study in the Spring. These
interviews will focus on the teacher's experiences with the T utor Corps initiativ e,
including students' perceptions around participating in tutoring. P articipants in the
teacher interviews will be offered a $30 gift card as a thank y ou and in recognition of
their time.
Interview or group interview with tutors: T utors at sampled PLI study schools will be
invited to a 30 minute virtual interview with the study team each spring. The team will
allow for group interviews with more than one tutor if scheduling requires that. These
interviews will focus on the tutor's experiences with the T utor Corps initiativ e.
Participants in the tutor interview will be offered a $30 gift card as a thank y ou and in
recognition of their time.
As described later in the application, the research team will coordinate with the CPS
Tutor Corps manager (Ellen Kim) to in vite schools to participate in these research
activities and then the research team will in vite individuals at participating schools to
take part in the v oluntary data collection activit y at a time that is con venient for them.","Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the
motivation, design, and implications of the project.
One k ey component of CPS's Mo ving F orward Together Plan is the CPS T utor Corps.
CPS  is partnering with The Univ ersity of Chicago Education Lab (Ed Lab), lead b y PI
Monica Bhatt, to study the impacts for students of receiving tutoring via the T utor
Corps. This impact study is focused on understanding the quantitativ e impact of
tutoring on student's academic outcomes, in particular as measured on the EO Y
Renaissance Star test. This study also in volves Ed Lab analyzing some administr ative
data about the implementation of the CPS T utor Corps. This research study is co vered
by CPS and Ed Lab's SoW #99.
In this RRB application, we propose an implementation study of the CPS T utor Corps
using site visits to participating schools (focus groups and interviews with k ey pla yers;
observ ations of tutoring sessions), and surv eys of k ey staff . This implementation
study  is intended to be a complement to the abo ve-mentioned secondary data
analysis  study . This  implementation study will be led b y our research partners at
MDRC (a non profit social policy research organization) and o verseen b y Ed Lab . The
implementation study will help us understand how the progr am is enacted and how
schools ha ve adapted the intended model to fit their context. The study will also aim
to describe how the new progr am compares to other forms of personaliz ed learning
and supplemental support that schools are offering their students. These goals to
identif y adaptations to the intended model and contr ast with t ypical pr actice are
particularly salient giv en the ongoing disruption of the co vid-19 pandemic. Moreo ver,
insights from this implementation study can inform potential plans for the deplo yment
of the CPS T utor Corps in upcoming y ears.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
RQ1) How was the CPS Tutor Corps delivered? To what extent was the CPS
Tutor Corps delivered as intended ? 
CPS has clearly articulated the k ey components of the research-based T utor Corps
model in its implementation manual for participating schools including the
infrastructure that CPS and the T utor Corps v endors will put into place to support
school’ s implementation. As is t ypical in an y education initiativ e at the start of
implementation, we expect to see challenges in the installation of infr astructure at the
district and school lev el and that these challenges will influence how well schools can
implement the model as intended. Through qualitativ e and quantitativ e research
methods, we also anticipate disco vering unexpected adaptations to implementation
that could support progr am impro vement in future y ears. 
RQ2) What was the context in which the CPS Tutor Corps was delivered?
What were the key challenges and implementation lessons?
An important phase of scaling up an initiativ e as complex and widespread as CPS T utor
Corps is the installation of the progr am. As is the case with an y new large-scale
initiativ e, there will be challenges associated with progr am start -up. These challenges
will be important to document alongside the impact study to help contextualiz e impact
findings and understand how best to strengthen the progr am in future y ears. W e also
expect to hear specifically about how and whether  the co vid-19 pandemic led to an y 
disruptions that could ha ve exacerbated t ypical progr am start -up challenges.
Additionally , we expect to hear of inno vations that the district, T utor Corps v endors
and schools put in place to address challenges and to identif y contextual factors that
supported schools in implementing despite an y challenges. Identif ying these
facilitators of implementation and adaptations will be critical to support CPS in
strengthening the model mo ving forw ard. 
RQ3) How does Tutor Corps compare to other personalized learning and
supplemental instruction opportunities at participating schools? 
Tutors Corps’ capacit y to ha ve a measur able impact on students’ learning is dependent
on the extent to which the progr am is different from (and more supportiv e than) what
participating students would ha ve receiv ed in its absence. Therefore, documenting the
other t ypes of personaliz ed learning opportunities and supplemental support services
that schools offer to students is important to understanding the impacts that will be
documented in the quantitativ e impact study . Furthermore, identif ying “business as
usual” can help driv e progr am impro vement efforts b y establishing what additional
services the T utor Corps progr am needs to offer in order for it to ha ve measur able
impact. In some schools, we expect that there ma y be elements of the T utor Corps
model (e.g. , opportunities for deliber ate pr actice and tailored instruction) a vailable to
non-participating students.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What
is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the
body of extant knowledge?
The pandemic resulted in sizable adv erse impacts on learning o verall and differential
impacts that ha ve further exacerbated inequalit y in students' academic outcomes.
Even before the pandemic, data showed significant and persistent disparities in
national schooling outcomes b y race and ethnicit y (de Brey et al. , 2019), income
(Reardon, 2011), and geogr aphy, such as between rur al and urban areas or across
regions of the country (Lippman et al. , 1996). Emerging descriptiv e data strongly
suggests that the pandemic has exacerbated these gaps. A recent working paper
projects the pandemic will result in significant slowing in the r ate of learning and
growth compared to previous cohorts of learners (about 30-40 percent for liter acy and
50-60 percent for math) (K uhfeld, et al. , 2020). Summer learning loss has relativ ely
larger impacts on students of color (A tteberry et al. , 2016) - this ma y hold true for
pandemic learning loss as well. 
Our status quo education system is not set up to address the unique needs of high-
needs students. T raditional classroom instruction is targeted to gr ade-lev el curriculum,
which can result in a ‘dev elopmental mismatch’ between the curriculum and the
material a high-needs student is currently ready to learn. Absent an interv ention,
these gaps can compound o ver time. If a 7th gr ade student is missing 6th gr ade skills,
they ma y not benefit from gr ade-lev el instruction, so that b y the end of the y ear they
are missing both 6th and 7th gr ade skills. T eachers often try to differentiate instruction
within the classroom, but the r ange in student skill lev els, widened b y the pandemic,
is likely to be too much to address through classroom instruction alone. High dosage
tutoring has the potential to help interrupt this cy cle. Tutoring reduces dev elopmental
mismatch because it is inherently personaliz ed and t ypically uses frequent formativ e
assessments. Students working with a tutor get immediate feedback (Thomas et al. ,
2013). By impro ving time on task tutoring can giv e students more opportunities to
practice and reinforce concepts, which can boost learning (Cooper et al. , 2006).
Tutoring can help motiv ate students through a ‘social capital’ or mentoring effect
(Coleman, 1988, Herrer a et al. , 2011).
Districts around the country are now planning to deplo y funding from the American
Recovery Plan (ARP) to acceler ate learning, particularly among high-needs students.
States and district are being encour aged to use high dosage tutoring (among other
strategies) to achiev e the goals of this in vestment. In Chicago , CPS has announced
they will dev ote $25 million of ARP funds to hiring 600 tutors in the 2021-22 school
year, and expanding to 850 tutors in the following y ear. This CPS T utor Corps will be
able to serv e up to 20,000 students per y ear (Cullotta, 2021). 
High dosage tutoring similar to the models used b y the CPS T utor Corps ha ve been
shown to be effectiv e on a small scale; that said,evidence of tutoring progr ams
delivered at scale is more mix ed and man y open questions remain (See Kr aft and
Falken, 2021 for review).  In particular , there is a large body of research on the
implementation and effectiv eness of No Child Left Behind’ s afterschool tutoring
services pro vided through Supplemental Education Services (SES). With some
exception, afterschool tutoring offered via SES w as found to be largely ineffectiv e at
impro ving student achiev ement (e.g. Dek e et al. , 2012; Heinrich et al. , 2010). The
failures of the SES progr am tutoring to achiev e its objectiv e at impro ving student
achiev ement ha ve been attributed to implementation challenges associated with the
progr am. In particular , researchers across progr ams in a number of districts found that
most students did not receiv e adequate dosage and there w as variation in instructional
qualit y, with man y progr ams not properly tailoring instruction to student needs and/or
aligning with classroom instruction (Good et al. , 2014).The CPS T utor Corps model addresses man y of these implementation challenges
through intentional progr am design features that closely mirror progr am features of
high dosage tutoring progr ams (e.g. , scheduled time for tutoring during school hours;
selection of research based curriculum materials) that ha ve been found to be highly
effectiv e (Gury an et al. , 2021). CPS’ T utor Corps model in the 2021-2022 school y ear
includes liter acy tutoring for elementary school students and math tutoring for middle
and high school students. The tutoring progr am and tr aining is pro vided b y an outside
vendor (Saga for math; Amplif y for liter acy). The tutors are hired and emplo yed by
CPS. CPS has hired a full-time T utor Corps director to o versee the progr am
implementation.
Whether and how schools enact that design with fidelit y and documenting the
adaptations they mak e along the w ay is critical to the building field’ s knowledge of
what it tak es to implement high-dosage tutoring at scale. CPS is among the first large
districts to stand up a high dosage tutoring model using ARP funding to address
pandemic related learning losses. Documenting implementation of this ambitious
progr am in its early y ears and identif ying best pr actices and lessons learned will
support progr am impro vement in CPS as the initiativ e matures and progr am
development in districts that are attempting to follow in CPS’ footsteps.","to Date
In spring of 2023, the Implementation R esearch team completed surv eys with tutor
coordinators and tutors. The team also conducted site visits to CPS schools to

The research team will field surv eys to two different respondents to help the team
understand how the T utor Corps progr am is being implemented.
The site coordinator surv ey will be administered to the T utor Corps initiativ e site
coordinator at each school, for a total of up to 45 schools. The surv ey will focus on
understanding how implementation of the tutoring model in pr actice at each school
and the resources dev oted to the tutoring progr am, including challenges faced and
lessons learned. The surv ey will help researchers understand how the school identifies
students for the receipt of supplemental instruction, what other t ypes of supplemental
instruction are a vailable at the school in addition to T utor Corps, as well insights on
time spent implementing the progr am. The surv ey will tak e appro ximately 30 minutes
to complete and participants will be offered a $30 gift card as a thank y ou and in
recognition of their time.
The research team will field a tutor surv ey to up to 4 times annually to tutors
participating in the PLI study in up to 45 schools. It will be fielded for the first time in
October and then up to 3 more times until Ma y. Over the course of the surv ey
administr ations (some questions v ary between administr ations), the surv ey will ask
tutors about session attendance on a t ypical da y, how they allocate their time to
various tutoring and tutoring related tasks, their perception of barriers and facilitators
to implementation, and the resources they use for tutoring. The early administr ations
of the surv ey will tak e no more than 10 minutes to complete, and participants will be
offered a $10 gift card as a thank y ou and in recognition of their time. The final surv ey
administr ation of the school- year will include extr a questions and will tak e up to 15
minutes to complete. This tutors will be offered a $15 dollar gift as a thank y ou for
their time for this administr ation and an additional $15 for ev ery additional school they
fill out the surv ey for if they tutor at multiple schools. Note that while the surv ey is
designed to be fielded up to 4 times per y ear and ma y be fielded that often in future

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the
motivation, design, and implications of the project.
One k ey component of CPS's Mo ving F orward Together Plan is the CPS T utor Corps.
CPS  is partnering with The Univ ersity of Chicago Education Lab (Ed Lab), lead b y PI
Monica Bhatt, to study the impacts for students of receiving tutoring via the T utor
Corps. This impact study is focused on understanding the quantitativ e impact of
tutoring on student's academic outcomes, in particular as measured on the EO Y
Renaissance Star test. This study also in volves Ed Lab analyzing some administr ative
data about the implementation of the CPS T utor Corps. This research study is co vered
by CPS and Ed Lab's SoW #99.
In this RRB application, we propose an implementation study of the CPS T utor Corps
using site visits to participating schools (focus groups and interviews with k ey pla yers;
observ ations of tutoring sessions), and surv eys of k ey staff . This implementation
study  is intended to be a complement to the abo ve-mentioned secondary data
analysis  study . This  implementation study will be led b y our research partners at
MDRC (a non profit social policy research organization) and o verseen b y Ed Lab . The
implementation study will help us understand how the progr am is enacted and how
schools ha ve adapted the intended model to fit their context. The study will also aim
to describe how the new progr am compares to other forms of personaliz ed learning
and supplemental support that schools are offering their students. These goals to
identif y adaptations to the intended model and contr ast with t ypical pr actice are
particularly salient giv en the ongoing disruption of the co vid-19 pandemic. Moreo ver,
insights from this implementation study can inform potential plans for the deplo yment
of the CPS T utor Corps in upcoming y ears.
 Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
RQ1) How was the CPS Tutor Corps delivered? To what extent was the CPS
Tutor Corps delivered as intended ? 
CPS has clearly articulated the k ey components of the research-based T utor Corps
model in its implementation manual for participating schools including the
infrastructure that CPS and the T utor Corps v endors will put into place to support
school’ s implementation. As is t ypical in an y education initiativ e at the start of
implementation, we expect to see challenges in the installation of infr astructure at the
district and school lev el and that these challenges will influence how well schools can
implement the model as intended. Through qualitativ e and quantitativ e research
methods, we also anticipate disco vering unexpected adaptations to implementation
that could support progr am impro vement in future y ears. 
RQ2) What was the context in which the CPS Tutor Corps was delivered?
What were the key challenges and implementation lessons?
An important phase of scaling up an initiativ e as complex and widespread as CPS T utor
Corps is the installation of the progr am. As is the case with an y new large-scale
initiativ e, there will be challenges associated with progr am start -up. These challenges
will be important to document alongside the impact study to help contextualiz e impact
findings and understand how best to strengthen the progr am in future y ears. W e also
expect to hear specifically about how and whether  the co vid-19 pandemic led to an y 
disruptions that could ha ve exacerbated t ypical progr am start -up challenges.
Additionally , we expect to hear of inno vations that the district, T utor Corps v endors
and schools put in place to address challenges and to identif y contextual factors that
supported schools in implementing despite an y challenges. Identif ying these
facilitators of implementation and adaptations will be critical to support CPS in
strengthening the model mo ving forw ard. 
RQ3) How does Tutor Corps compare to other personalized learning and
supplemental instruction opportunities at participating schools? 
Tutors Corps’ capacit y to ha ve a measur able impact on students’ learning is dependent
on the extent to which the progr am is different from (and more supportiv e than) what
participating students would ha ve receiv ed in its absence. Therefore, documenting the
other t ypes of personaliz ed learning opportunities and supplemental support services
that schools offer to students is important to understanding the impacts that will be
documented in the quantitativ e impact study . Furthermore, identif ying “business as
usual” can help driv e progr am impro vement efforts b y establishing what additional
services the T utor Corps progr am needs to offer in order for it to ha ve measur able
impact. In some schools, we expect that there ma y be elements of the T utor Corps
model (e.g. , opportunities for deliber ate pr actice and tailored instruction) a vailable to
non-participating students. 
 Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What
is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the
body of extant knowledge?
The pandemic resulted in sizable adv erse impacts on learning o verall and differential
impacts that ha ve further exacerbated inequalit y in students' academic outcomes.
Even before the pandemic, data showed significant and persistent disparities in
national schooling outcomes b y race and ethnicit y (de Brey et al. , 2019), income
(Reardon, 2011), and geogr aphy, such as between rur al and urban areas or across
regions of the country (Lippman et al. , 1996). Emerging descriptiv e data strongly
suggests that the pandemic has exacerbated these gaps. A recent working paper
projects the pandemic will result in significant slowing in the r ate of learning and
growth compared to previous cohorts of learners (about 30-40 percent for liter acy and
50-60 percent for math) (K uhfeld, et al. , 2020). Summer learning loss has relativ ely
larger impacts on students of color (A tteberry et al. , 2016) - this ma y hold true for
pandemic learning loss as well. 
Our status quo education system is not set up to address the unique needs of high-
needs students. T raditional classroom instruction is targeted to gr ade-lev el curriculum,
which can result in a ‘dev elopmental mismatch’ between the curriculum and the
material a high-needs student is currently ready to learn. Absent an interv ention,
these gaps can compound o ver time. If a 7th gr ade student is missing 6th gr ade skills,
they ma y not benefit from gr ade-lev el instruction, so that b y the end of the y ear they
are missing both 6th and 7th gr ade skills. T eachers often try to differentiate instruction
within the classroom, but the r ange in student skill lev els, widened b y the pandemic,
is likely to be too much to address through classroom instruction alone. High dosage
tutoring has the potential to help interrupt this cy cle. Tutoring reduces dev elopmental
mismatch because it is inherently personaliz ed and t ypically uses frequent formativ e
assessments. Students working with a tutor get immediate feedback (Thomas et al. ,
2013). By impro ving time on task tutoring can giv e students more opportunities to
practice and reinforce concepts, which can boost learning (Cooper et al. , 2006).
Tutoring can help motiv ate students through a ‘social capital’ or mentoring effect
(Coleman, 1988, Herrer a et al. , 2011).
Districts around the country are now planning to deplo y funding from the American
Recovery Plan (ARP) to acceler ate learning, particularly among high-needs students.
States and district are being encour aged to use high dosage tutoring (among other
strategies) to achiev e the goals of this in vestment. In Chicago , CPS has announced
they will dev ote $25 million of ARP funds to hiring 600 tutors in the 2021-22 school
year, and expanding to 850 tutors in the following y ear. This CPS T utor Corps will be
able to serv e up to 20,000 students per y ear (Cullotta, 2021). 
High dosage tutoring similar to the models used b y the CPS T utor Corps ha ve been
shown to be effectiv e on a small scale; that said,evidence of tutoring progr ams
delivered at scale is more mix ed and man y open questions remain (See Kr aft and
Falken, 2021 for review).  In particular , there is a large body of research on the
implementation and effectiv eness of No Child Left Behind’ s afterschool tutoring
services pro vided through Supplemental Education Services (SES). With some
exception, afterschool tutoring offered via SES w as found to be largely ineffectiv e at
impro ving student achiev ement (e.g. Dek e et al. , 2012; Heinrich et al. , 2010). The
failures of the SES progr am tutoring to achiev e its objectiv e at impro ving student
achiev ement ha ve been attributed to implementation challenges associated with the
progr am. In particular , researchers across progr ams in a number of districts found that
most students did not receiv e adequate dosage and there w as variation in instructional
qualit y, with man y progr ams not properly tailoring instruction to student needs and/or
aligning with classroom instruction (Good et al. , 2014).The CPS T utor Corps model addresses man y of these implementation challenges
through intentional progr am design features that closely mirror progr am features of
high dosage tutoring progr ams (e.g. , scheduled time for tutoring during school hours;
selection of research based curriculum materials) that ha ve been found to be highly
effectiv e (Gury an et al. , 2021). CPS’ T utor Corps model in the 2021-2022 school y ear
includes liter acy tutoring for elementary school students and math tutoring for middle
and high school students. The tutoring progr am and tr aining is pro vided b y an outside
vendor (Saga for math; Amplif y for liter acy). The tutors are hired and emplo yed by
CPS. CPS has hired a full-time T utor Corps director to o versee the progr am
implementation.
Whether and how schools enact that design with fidelit y and documenting the
adaptations they mak e along the w ay is critical to the building field’ s knowledge of
what it tak es to implement high-dosage tutoring at scale. CPS is among the first large
districts to stand up a high dosage tutoring model using ARP funding to address
pandemic related learning losses. Documenting implementation of this ambitious
progr am in its early y ears and identif ying best pr actices and lessons learned will
support progr am impro vement in CPS as the initiativ e matures and progr am
development in districts that are attempting to follow in CPS’ footsteps.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated
with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will
be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
This implementation study in volves conducting surv eys of k ey staff in volved in the
initiativ e  about their experiences in volving CPS T utor Corps, virtual qualitativ e data
collection with k ey staff (e.g tutors, teachers and school coordinators) and review of
secondary data collected b y the Ed Lab T A team (co vered in SoW #99 Amendment 01
and CPS RRB 2023-1901)
 
Tutor Coordinator Interview:  The research team will host interviews with up with
Tutor Corps site coordinators ( people designated b y their school leader as o verseeing
the Tutor Corps progr am) for 60 minutes virtually each spring with site coordinators in
up to 45 participating schools.  The interview will focus on understanding how
implementation of the model is rolling out at each school, including challenges faced
and lessons learned. These interviews will also focus on the systems and resources
that the school put in place to set up the progr am (e.g. scheduling; student selection),
including challenges and lessons learned. P articipants will be offered a $60 gift card as
a thank y ou and in recognition of their time. 
Tutor Interviews/Group Interview :  The research team will host individual or
group interviews for tutors in up to 45 schools for up to 30 minutes. All tutors at each
participating school will be in vited to participate in the focus group outside of their
contract work hours. T utor focus groups will primarily ask about tutors’ perceptions of
what has gone well in the progr am and what could be impro ved, including their
reflections on specific implementation challenges identified in prior liter ature (e.g.
student and tutor absence).  P articipants in group interviews will be offered a $30 gift
card as a thank y ou and in recognition of their time. 
Secondary data: The PLI study team is collecting administr ative data and other data
as part of their deliv ery of technical assistance to support strong implementation of
Tutor Corps in participating school s(e.g. tutoring observ ations). Appro val for this data
is covered in  in SoW #99 Amendment 01 and CPS RRB 2023-1901. If those activities
are appro ved, the PLI study team will use that data for the implementation research
activities but will nev er receiv e student -level identifiable records.
Surveys: The research team will field two surv eys with two t ypes of respondents to
help the team understand how the T utor Corps initiativ e is being implemented.
The site coordinator surv ey will be administered to the T utor Corps initiativ e site
coordinator at each school participating in the implementation study . The surv ey will
focus on understanding how implementation of the model is rolling out at each school,
including challenges faced and lessons learned, and the resources used in dev eloping
the progr am. The surv ey will tak e appro ximately 30 minutes to complete. All site
coordinator each participating schools will be in vited via email to complete the
voluntary surv ey. Participants will be offered a $30 gift card as a thank y ou and in
recognition of their time.
The research team will field a surv ey to tutors at participating PLI study schools up to
4 times annually . It will be fielded for the first time in October and then up to 3 more
times until Ma y. Over the course of the surv ey administr ations (some questions v ary
between administr ations), the surv ey will ask tutors about session attendance on a
typical da y, how they allocate their time to v arious tutoring and tutoring related tasks,
their perception of barriers and facilitators to implementation, and the resources they
use for tutoring. The early administr ations of the surv ey will tak e no more than 10
minutes to complete, and participants will be offered a $10 gift card as a thank y ouand in recognition of their time. The final surv ey administr ation of the school- year will
include extr a questions and will tak e up to 15 minutes to complete. T utors will be
offered a $15 dollar gift as a thank y ou for their time for this administr ation and an
additional $15 for ev ery additional school they fill out the surv ey for if they tutor at
multiple schools.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
Data collected and analyz ed via the implementation study (proposed in this RRB) is
intended to complement the secondary data analysis about the T utor Corps conducted
by Ed Lab (co vered b y Ed Lab SOW #99; CPS RRB 2023-1901). T aken together , the
two studies will help us answer the three research questions. The table below outlines
the data sources and analytic str ategies planned to address each research question.
While the primary data collection/analysis (co vered b y this RRB and 2023-1901) and
the secondary data analysis (co vered b y SoW #99) will help us answer the same
research questions, we will be careful to ensure all members of the research team only
have access to the data they ha ve permission to access, and which is required for
their study responsibilities. (In particular , as described in SoW #99 Amdt 01, the
Education Lab will not share an y CPS student -level administr ative data with the MDRC
research team.)

provided within the school.) All interviews would tak e place in a teacher's
classroom, with the teacher present. The initial interview is expected to tak e
appro ximately 45 minutes to 1 hour , depending on the length of the
participant's answers. The two follow -up interviews are expected to tak e
appro ximately 30 minutes.
For teachers, interviews are expected last 45-60 minutes and will tak e place
at a time and place of their choosing. This might be their classroom at the

This study will in vestigate how Chicago Public School students in gr ades 7-
12 engage with poetry through classroom instruction pro vided b y Teaching
Artists affiliated with the Chicago P oetry Center . Building on recent
scholarship in the anthropology of education, linguistic anthropology , and
urban anthropology , I ask: 1) How do T As and teachers collabor atively
mobiliz e poetry -focused pedagogy in Chicago’ s public high school and middle
school classrooms, and with what goals? 2) How do T As’ relationships with
students through such progr ams affect students’ understandings of
themselv es and abilities to express those understandings? 3) How do
students mobiliz e poetry as a form of engagement with the world outside of
the classroom? Methods of data collection will include: in-depth, semi-
structured interviews with T As, students, and teachers; participant
observ ation in weekly T A-led classes in Chicago schools; participating in and
analyzing the dev elopment of curricular materials b y CPC; and dev eloping
qualitativ e evaluation tools to assess the growth of students’ thinking. The
results of this study will offer k ey insights into how Chicago Public Schools
students use creativ e outlets to mak e meaning of both their education and
their liv ed experiences outside of school. It will also show how consistent
mentoring relationships can foster students’ self -expression through
socioemotional support. Finally , in the w ake of the pandemic, this project will
provide an in-depth, la yered picture of how students, teachers, and T eaching
Artists creativ ely collabor ate to heal from the pandemic’ s disruptions to
communit y.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Using qualitativ e data collection, including ethnogr aphic techniques and
document analysis, this research aims to answer the following:
1) How do T eaching Artists and classroom teachers collabor atively mobiliz e
poetry -focused pedagogy in Chicago’ s public high school classrooms and
extracurriculars, and with what goals?
Hypothesis 1: T As and classroom teachers use poetry -focused pedagogy to
foster students' interest in and abilities to express feelings and experiences
through writing. By joining together the reading and writing of poetic texts,
TAs help students increase their confidence in both.
2) How do T As’ relationships with students through such progr ams affect
students’ understandings of themselv es and abilities to express those
understandings?
Hypothesis 2: T As model a curiosit y about words, feelings, and experiences,
and show students how they can share their worlds with others. Students
understand their words as worth y of being read and published, and view
poetry as a tool for making their thoughts heard.
3) How do students mobiliz e poetry as a form of engagement with the world
outside of the classroom?
Hypothesis 3: Students use poetry writing time to br ainstorm and write
about their families, the neighborhood and cit y they liv e in, and the issues
they care about. By the end of the semester , they confidently share their
views and experiences through poetry .
These methods will yield a longitudinal, qualitativ e data set that offers
unique insights into the da y-to-da y progr amming of CPC and student
interactions with T eaching Artists. Unlik e traditional educational research
methods, an ethnogr aphic approach will allow me to capture and share a
nuanced portr ait of students' self -expressiv e and socioemotional growth o ver
the course of the school y ear. This information, which will be shared with
CPC and with CPS staff in appropriate forums, can help guide future
progr amming decisions and demonstr ate the impacts of arts education in
this critical historical moment.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Motiv ated b y what Debor ah Thomas  (2021) has called “an archiv e of life, ”
this project seeks to contribute to anthropological understandings of how
people form communit y. By closely studying mentoring relationships and the
writing they produce, I will demonstr ate how urban y outh and their mentors
actively create an archiv e of subjecthood. In examining how y outh co-
construct their subjectivities in concert with mentors, and in the context of
public schools, we can come to a more thorough understanding of how cities
make and are made b y networks of individuals, and how those individuals
shape and are shaped b y the cit y. I draw on linguistic anthropology as well
as the anthropology of education to in vestigate poetry as a subject -forming
medium. Linguistic anthropologists ha ve found classrooms to be fertile
grounds for y oung people to work out their subjectivities (Chumley 2016,
Abu El-Haj 2009). Additionally , there is ample anthropological evidence
supporting the importance of poetry and poetic activities as a medium for
conveying, challenging, and pla ying with ideologies (Sherz er 1987; W ebster
2009). The political nature of y outh subject formation has also been studied
by anthropologists. Previous studies highlight how y outh depart from
learning as a process of memorization and reproduction and instead mo ve
toward various forms of self -expression to mak e sense of the world
(Bucholtz 2002, Chumley 2016, Hemment 2015, K won 2013). My project
builds on these studies b y closely reading the w ays in which adults and
adolescents work together to (re)write y outh subjectivities. Lastly , I draw on
urban anthropology to examine the contribution of poetry to y outh sense-
making activities in the cit y. As the birthplace of urban ethnogr aphy, Chicago
has long been a focal point for researchers in vestigating urban po verty and
racial segregation (Dr ake & Ca yton 1945, P attillo 2013, R alph 2014, Stack
1974). Dr awing on discourses about how artists and the arts broadly pla y a
role in cit y life (Abdul Khabeer 2018, P eterson 2012, Zukin 2010), I will
further explore how mentoring relationships between Chicago's working
poets and y oung Chicagoans facilitate students’ abilit y to express their
subjectivities through poetry .","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
            T o gain insight into how and wh y poets and teachers mobiliz e
poetry -focused pedagogy with middle and high school students, I will work
with 3-4 T As to observ e and reflect on their lessons. I will shadow T As over
the course of one y ear (20 lessons - January -June 2022, September -
December 2022), observing their lessons with students and meeting with
them afterw ards for semi-structured, reflectiv e interviews. I will also
conduct interviews with classroom teachers, discussing their experiences
working with T As and the reasons they choose to partner with CPC.
Additionally , I will conduct document analysis of CPC’ s lesson plan archiv e,
identif ying k ey themes that emerge around learning objectiv es, lesson
content and activities, and formativ e assessments. I will compare and cross-
reference lesson plans with m y in-class observ ation notes. I will also use a
“Looking at Student W ork” fr amework (Easton 2009) to closely read
students’ written assignments alongside the instruction they receiv e from
TAs. Lastly , I plan to conduct archiv al research using CPC’ s records from
previous school y ears, previous student ev aluations (anon ymous), and
written feedback from T As.
            T o better understand the formation of mentoring relationships
among T As and students, I will use participant observ ation and in-depth
interviews with T As, classroom teachers, and students. In addition to
observing individual students during class sessions, I will recruit at least ten
students in each class to complete semi-structured interviews focused on
their experiences in the class. These interviews will address topics such as:
what the student understands to be the goals of the lesson; how the student
views the T A; and what close relationships, if an y, the student has formed
with adults outside their immediate family . The answers to these questions
will help show how the student thinks about mentorship and their prior
experiences with it as well as their perception of their own relationship with
the TA. I will also conduct semi-structured interviews with T As and
classroom teachers to learn what they ha ve noticed about student learning
during poetry class.
            T o explore the w ays students engage with poetry to mak e sense of
their liv es and subjectivities, I will conduct semi-structured interviews with
10 students per class at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester .
During these interviews, I will ask students questions about how they see
themselv es as Chicagoans and what they hope for the future. I will also ask
them to select a poem they enjo y or a poem they ha ve written and discuss
what is important to them about the poem. In June (close to the end of the
school y ear), I will ask participating students in each class to v olunteer to
share poems they ha ve written along with their commentary on wh y they
wrote them. With students’ and parents’ permission, I will record these
conversations and edit them into a podcast to be shared through the CPC
website.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
My methods of data collection include: in-depth, semi-structured interviews
with T As, teachers, and students (R ossman & R allis 2012); participant
observ ation in weekly T A-led classes in Chicago high schools; participating in
and analyzing the planning and dev elopment of curricular materials b y CPC;
and dev eloping qualitativ e evaluation tools to assess the growth of students’
thinking o ver the course of the y ear.
I will begin analyzing data concurrently with data collection using qualitativ e
data softw are (NViv o) and reflectiv e memos. I will organiz e qualitativ e data
(typed field notes, tr anscribed interviews, poems, lesson plans) in folders b y
week, with a reflectiv e memo for each folder on gener al impressions based
on the data collected during that week. I will use NViv o to code for themes
and trends. I will also utiliz e tags in Z otero citation softw are to link notes on
relevant liter ature to the emergent themes in the data. This will streamline
the write-up process and allow me to refine the questions in follow -up
interviews with participants. I will cross-reference themes from interviews
and observ ations with lesson plans and other curricular materials. T o more
closely analyz e discourse, I will identif y key ex cerpts from individual
interviews, as well as poems, that engage with subject formation. In
particular , I will attend to v oice and register (Agha 2005, 2011; R eyes 2016)
to draw analytical connections between participants’ own subjectivities and
the socially -recognizable personae they in voke in both poetry and inter action
with each other .
With participants’ permission, interviews will be audio-recorded for accur ate
transcription. During participant observ ation, I will tak e jottings and more
detailed notes the same da y to ensure accur acy and detail (Bernard 2011).
With permission, I will audio-record individual students' readings of their
poems for detailed textual and performance analysis. Throughout m y field
work, I will k eep a file with locally and nationally significant news stories
that I hear poets engaging with in performance and interviews. I will obtain
appro val for this research from both Brown Univ ersity’s IRB and Chicago
Public Schools, and I will abide b y univ ersity guidelines regarding tr avel and
human subjects research, should COVID-19 conditions change.
            In the ev ent that Chicago Public Schools or the Chicago P oetry
Center determines progr amming should be conducted remotely , I will
conduct observ ations of synchronous classes via Google Classroom (CPS and
CPC’s virtual learning pro vider). I will conduct interviews via Google, with
password-protected sessions."

Documented suicide is the third-leading cause of death for African American
males, ages 10 -24, and females, ages 15-19 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prev ention [CDC], 2016). There are v ery few empirically tested and
effectiv e suicide prev ention interv entions, designed specifically for African
American y outh (Goldston et al. , 2008; W ong, Maffini, & Shin, 2014). This is
despite growing support for the importance of cultur ally-grounded
interv entions, particularly for the prev ention of adolescent suicide (Bry ant &
Harder , 2008; Joe, Canetto , & Romer, 2008; Lauricella, V aldez, Okamoto ,
Helm, & Z aremba, 2016).
The Adapted-Coping with Stress Course (A-CWS ) is a 15-session school-
based, cultur ally-grounded coping skills interv ention designed specifically for
African American adolescents. The A-CWS  has r aised adaptiv e coping
(Robinson, Droege, Case & Jason, 2015) and evidenced a relativ e risk
reduction of 86% for suicide among adolescents receiving the interv ention,
compared to standard care control participants (R obinson et al. , 2016). 
School-based health center (SBHC) social work ers are indigenous service
providers within schools and ideal agents of change to sustain school-based
interv entions. This study will tr ain indigenous SBHC social work ers to
implement the A-CWS interv ention and test the effectiv eness of their service
delivery on k ey outcomes of interest. This is a v ery achiev able next step;
other studies report good success in tr aining school personnel to implement,
with fidelit y, school-based mental health interv entions within schools in the
Chicago area (A tkins, Gr aczyk, Fr azier & Abdul- Adil, 2003), as well as other
large urban cities (Cappella et al. , 2012; K ellam et al. , 2008).
The present r andomiz ed controlled trial will establish the effectiv eness of the
A-CWS  and test h ypotheses pertaining to moder ators and the mechanism of
change b y which the A-CWS reduces suicide risk. Additionally , this study is
expected to augment current theoretical models of adolescent suicidalit y.
Most importantly , this effectiv eness trial will inform procedures for scaling up
efficacious, high qualit y, and cultur ally-grounded suicide prev ention
progr ams for African American y outh; as such, this study is pr actice relev ant
and expected to inform best pr actices for the prev ention of suicide among
African American adolescents. The specific aims are:
1. To examine the effectiv eness of the A-CWS  interv ention, as deliv ered b y
indigenous SBHC social work ers, to reduce activ e suicidal ideation, within a
sample of low -resourced, urban African American adolescents.
2. To understand the mechanism b y which the A-CWS interv ention reduces
suicide risk for low -resourced, urban African American adolescents.
3. To establish the fidelit y of an evidence-based, cultur ally-grounded coping

Documented suicide is the third-leading cause of death for African American
males, ages 10 -24, and females, ages 15-19 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prev ention [CDC], 2016). A recent Y outh Risk Beha vior Surv ey (CDC,
2017) reports that, among 9th gr ade students, the prev alence of attempted
suicide is higher for African American females (11.9%) than white females
(9.4%) and higher for African American males (6.1%) than white males
(3.5%). Additionally , for African American children, ages 5-11, the suicide
rate nearly doubled from 1993-2012, as r ates among European American
children declined (Bridge et al. , 2015). Suicide prev ention is challenging for
African American y outh, wherein suicidalit y is shrouded in a mor ass of
cultur al stigmas and taboos, lik ely resulting in underestimates of the true
prevalence of suicidalit y in these y outh (Goldston et al. , 2008; Huguet,
Kaplan, & McF arland, 2012).
According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), suicide is a
major , prev entable public health problem (NIMH, 2018). Studies ha ve shown
that suicidal ideation (Lewinsohn, R ohde, and Seeley , 1996), particularly
active suicidal ideation (P osner et al. , 2011), is associated with greater
likelihood of suicide attempt. These studies highlight the importance of
prevention efforts that aim to reduce activ e suicidal ideation in order to
prevent actual suicide attempts.
The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (Joiner , 2005) is one modern da y theory
of suicide that has been empirically supported in y oung African Americans
(Davidson, Wingate, Slish, and R asmussen, 2010; Hollingsworth, Wingate,
Tucker, O'Keefe, & Cole, 2016; T omek, Burton, Hooper , Bolland, & Bolland,
2018). Joiner (2005) posits that th warted belongingness and perceiv ed
burdensomeness must co-occur in order for an individual to dev elop activ e
suicidal ideation. Th warted belongingness occurs when an individual feels a
need to belong, but this need is unmet due to experiencing social isolation
from v alued groups, including family and friends. P erceiv ed burdensomeness
is the perception that one's existence is a burden to others. The
Interpersonal Theory further proposes that th warted belongingness and
perceiv ed burdensomeness will only lead to activ e suicidal ideation when
there is hopelessness regarding these two states, or the belief that these
two states will not impro ve (Hagan, P odlogar , Chu, & Joiner , 2015; V an
Orden et al. , 2010). From a positiv e psy chological perspectiv e, hope has
been posited to protect against the dev elopment of activ e suicidal ideation
when th warted belongingness and perceiv ed burdensomeness are present
(Hollingsworth et al. , 2016; Wingate et al. , 2006). Hope and hopelessness
are not simply opposite ends of one dimension (Grew al & P orter, 2007).
In addition, low -resourced, urban African American y outh often contend with
additiv e socio-ecological stressors, namely po verty and systemic r acism,
that can lead to heightened suicide risk. Howev er, there is empirical
evidence that adaptiv e coping str ategies can protect against suicide risk b y
reducing hopelessness (Barrett, Sonderegger , & Sonderegger , 2001; Gillhamet al., 2012) and suicidal ideation (R obinson et al. , 2016; Thompson, Eggert,
Randell, & Pik e, 2001), and b y increasing hope (Kirschman, R oberts,
Shadlow , & Pelley, 2010).
There are v ery few empirically tested and effectiv e suicide prev ention
interv entions, designed specifically for African American y outh (Goldston et
al., 2008; W ong, Maffini, & Shin, 2014). This is despite growing support for
the importance of cultur ally-grounded interv entions, particularly for the
prevention of adolescent suicide (Bry ant & Harder , 2008; Joe, Canetto , &
Romer, 2008; Lauricella, V aldez, Okamoto , Helm, & Z aremba, 2016). The
complexit y and sensitivit y of suicide prev ention with African American y outh
renders cultur ally-grounded suicide prev ention interv entions especially
important for these y outh (Goldston et al. , 2008; W alker, Lester , & Joe,
2006)
The Adapted-Coping with Stress Course (A-CWS ) is a 15-session school-
based, cultur ally-grounded coping skills interv ention designed specifically for
African American adolescents. The A-CWS  has r aised adaptiv e coping
(Robinson, Droege, Case & Jason, 2015) and evidenced a relativ e risk
reduction of 86% for suicide among adolescents receiving the interv ention,
compared to standard care control participants (R obinson et al. , 2016). 
School-based health center (SBHC) social work ers are indigenous service
providers within schools and ideal agents of change to sustain school-based
interv entions. This study will tr ain indigenous SBHC social work ers to
implement the A-CWS interv ention and test the effectiv eness of their service

We propose pro viding up to fiv e A-CWS interv ention booster sessions during
the 2024-2025 school y ear with Cohort 3 students. Only Cohort 3 students in
the A-CWS interv ention condition will be offered booster sessions. The
booster sessions will summariz e and review content from A -CWS interv ention
sessions pro vided during the 2023-2024 school y ear. For Cohort 3 students
who already participated in 10 or more A -CWS sessions during the 2023-
2024 school y ear, we propose obtaining parent/guardian permission and
student assent for student participation in the booster sessions. W e propose
providing students $7 for returning their signed parent/guardian permission
addendum form. F or Cohort 3 students who participated in less than 10 A -
CWS sessions during the 2023-2024 school y ear, we propose that
parent/guardian permission and student assent for the booster sessions is
already co vered under the parent/guardian permission and student assent

Secondary Data R equestPlease outline your protocol for survey activities, describing when,
where, duration, frequency, and with whom.
Cohort 1 students: will be ask ed to complete two follow -up surv eys, once
during the fall/winter of this academic y ear and once during the spring of
this academic y ear. Follow-up surv eys will ask students about their
experiences, thoughts, beha viors, and feelings, some of which are related to
stress and harm. Each surv ey will tak e appro ximately 30-45 minutes to
complete. Surv eys will be completed at school.
Cohort 1 P arents: will be ask ed to complete up to two follow -up surv eys,
once during the fall/winter of this academic y ear and once during the spring
of this y ear. Follow-up surv eys will ask questions about their child’ s
experiences, thoughts, feelings and beha viors, some of which are related to
stress and self -harm. Each surv ey tak es about 30-60 minutes to complete.
Parents will either speak with project staff o ver the phone or meet with
project staff to complete the surv ey. Parents will meet with project staff at
their home, or at a jointly acceptable location of their choosing.
Cohort 2 students in the A -CWS condition: will be ask ed to complete four
total surv eys. First, they will complete a 45-60 minute baseline surv ey that
will ask about their background (e.g. , age, gender and ethnicit y), along with
their experiences, thoughts, beha viors, and feelings, some of which are
related to stress and harm. They will later will be ask ed to complete a 30-45
minute surv ey that also asks about their experiences, thoughts, beha viors,
and feelings, some of which are related to stress and harm. They will be
asked to complete the 30-45 minute surv ey three times: (1) about 8-15
weeks after completing the baseline surv ey, (2) again 6 months after the
first time they complete the surv ey, and (3) about 6 months after the
second time they complete the third surv ey.
Cohort 2 students in the Control Condition: will be ask ed to complete four
total surv eys. First, they will complete a 45-60 minute baseline surv ey that
will ask about their background (e.g. , age, gender and ethnicit y), along with
their experiences, thoughts, beha viors, and feelings, some of which are
related to stress and harm. They will later will be ask ed to complete a 30-45
minute surv ey that also asks about their experiences, thoughts, beha viors,
and feelings, some of which are related to stress and harm. They will be
asked to complete the 30-45 minute surv ey three times: (1) right after the
15-session coping with stress progr am at their school, (2) appro ximately 6
months after the progr am ends, and (3) again, appro ximately 12 months
after the progr am ends.
Cohort 2 P arents: will be ask ed to complete up to four total surv eys: (1)
after returning the parent consent form, (2) after about 6 months, (3) after
about 12 months, and (4) after about 18 months. Surv eys will ask questions
about their child’ s experiences, thoughts, feelings and beha viors, some of
which are related to stress, self -harm, and violence. Each surv ey tak es
about 30-60 minutes to complete. P arents will either speak with staff o ver
the phone or meet with study staff to complete the surv ey. Parents ma y
meet with study staff at their home, or at a jointly acceptable location of
their choosing.Cohort 2 T eachers: will be ask ed to complete a surv ey about some of the
students they teach who are participating in the study . The surv ey will
assess their students’ feelings, beha viors, and inter actions with others. The
survey will tak e about 15-30 minutes to complete, per participating student.
Teachers will be ask ed to complete the surv ey up to four times: (1) first,
after returning the teacher consent form, (2) then after about 6 months, (3)
after about 12 months, and (4) after about 18 months.
Cohort 3: Surv ey activities for Cohort 3 will be the same as Cohort 2.
Amendment R57: W e propose changing the teacher surv ey
(LR060519PSY_R12_Measures_T eacher) from a paper surv ey to an
electronic surv ey on Qualtrics. The questions ask ed on the electronic surv ey
are the same as the paper surv ey.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
All participants will be assigned a unique ID number . These ID numbers,
rather than names, will be used with all surv eys and data collected to
distinguish participants. All surv ey data will be k ept in lock ed file cabinets
and password protected databases. The document which links names to ID
numbers will be k ept at a separ ate and different project office, in a lock ed
cabinet that is separ ate from where the data will be k ept. Only the
Investigators, Project Director , and data manager will ha ve access to this
document. This document will be destro yed at the end of the study .   
Address, demogr aphic, and other data that we ha ve collected, which is
necessary for contacting participants o ver time, will be k ept in a separ ate

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Documented suicide is the third-leading cause of death for African American
males, ages 10 -24, and females, ages 15-19 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prev ention [CDC], 2016). There are v ery few empirically tested and
effectiv e suicide prev ention interv entions, designed specifically for African
American y outh (Goldston et al. , 2008; W ong, Maffini, & Shin, 2014). This is
despite growing support for the importance of cultur ally-grounded
interv entions, particularly for the prev ention of adolescent suicide (Bry ant &
Harder , 2008; Joe, Canetto , & Romer, 2008; Lauricella, V aldez, Okamoto ,
Helm, & Z aremba, 2016).
The Adapted-Coping with Stress Course (A-CWS ) is a 15-session school-
based, cultur ally-grounded coping skills interv ention designed specifically for
African American adolescents. The A-CWS  has r aised adaptiv e coping
(Robinson, Droege, Case & Jason, 2015) and evidenced a relativ e risk
reduction of 86% for suicide among adolescents receiving the interv ention,
compared to standard care control participants (R obinson et al. , 2016). 
School-based health center (SBHC) social work ers are indigenous service
providers within schools and ideal agents of change to sustain school-based
interv entions. This study will tr ain indigenous SBHC social work ers to
implement the A-CWS interv ention and test the effectiv eness of their service
delivery on k ey outcomes of interest. This is a v ery achiev able next step;
other studies report good success in tr aining school personnel to implement,
with fidelit y, school-based mental health interv entions within schools in the
Chicago area (A tkins, Gr aczyk, Fr azier & Abdul- Adil, 2003), as well as other
large urban cities (Cappella et al. , 2012; K ellam et al. , 2008).
The present r andomiz ed controlled trial will establish the effectiv eness of the
A-CWS  and test h ypotheses pertaining to moder ators and the mechanism of
change b y which the A-CWS reduces suicide risk. Additionally , this study is
expected to augment current theoretical models of adolescent suicidalit y.
Most importantly , this effectiv eness trial will inform procedures for scaling up
efficacious, high qualit y, and cultur ally-grounded suicide prev ention
progr ams for African American y outh; as such, this study is pr actice relev ant
and expected to inform best pr actices for the prev ention of suicide among
African American adolescents. The specific aims are:
1. To examine the effectiv eness of the A-CWS  interv ention, as deliv ered b y
indigenous SBHC social work ers, to reduce activ e suicidal ideation, within a
sample of low -resourced, urban African American adolescents.
2. To understand the mechanism b y which the A-CWS interv ention reduces
suicide risk for low -resourced, urban African American adolescents.
3. To establish the fidelit y of an evidence-based, cultur ally-grounded coping
with stress interv ention (i.e. , the A-CWS ), dev eloped for low -resourced,
urban African American adolescents, deliv ered b y indigenous SBHC social
workers.4. To understand the extent that th warted belongingness, perceiv ed
burdensomeness, and socio-ecological factors influence the dev elopment of
active suicidal ideation.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Research question 1. What is the effectiv eness of the A-CWS  interv ention, as
delivered b y indigenous SBHC social work ers, on activ e suicidal ideation,
within a sample of low -resourced, urban African American adolescents? It
hypothesiz ed that the A-CWS will lead to reductions in activ e suicidal
ideation.
Research question 2. What is the mechanism b y which the A-CWS
interv ention reduces suicide risk for low -resourced, urban African American
adolescents? It h ypothesiz ed that the A-CWS  interv ention reduces suicide
risk b y impro ving adaptiv e coping skills.
Research question 3. What is the fidelit y of an evidence-based, cultur ally-
grounded coping with stress interv ention (i.e. , the A-CWS ), dev eloped for
low-resourced, urban African American adolescents, deliv ered b y indigenous
SBHC social work ers? Is h ypothesiz ed that indigenous SBHC social work ers
will deliv er the A-CWS  with high lev els of fidelit y.
Research question 4. T o what extent do th warted belongingness, perceiv ed
burdensomeness, and socio-ecological factors influence the dev elopment of
active suicidal ideation in low -resourced, urban African American
adolescents? It is h ypothesiz ed that th warted belongingness, perceiv ed
burdensomeness, and socio-ecological factors (e.g. , racism, communit y
violence exposure) will predict increased activ e suicidal ideation.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Documented suicide is the third-leading cause of death for African American
males, ages 10 -24, and females, ages 15-19 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prev ention [CDC], 2016). A recent Y outh Risk Beha vior Surv ey (CDC,
2017) reports that, among 9th gr ade students, the prev alence of attempted
suicide is higher for African American females (11.9%) than white females
(9.4%) and higher for African American males (6.1%) than white males
(3.5%). Additionally , for African American children, ages 5-11, the suicide
rate nearly doubled from 1993-2012, as r ates among European American
children declined (Bridge et al. , 2015). Suicide prev ention is challenging for
African American y outh, wherein suicidalit y is shrouded in a mor ass of
cultur al stigmas and taboos, lik ely resulting in underestimates of the true
prevalence of suicidalit y in these y outh (Goldston et al. , 2008; Huguet,
Kaplan, & McF arland, 2012).
According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), suicide is a
major , prev entable public health problem (NIMH, 2018). Studies ha ve shown
that suicidal ideation (Lewinsohn, R ohde, and Seeley , 1996), particularly
active suicidal ideation (P osner et al. , 2011), is associated with greater
likelihood of suicide attempt. These studies highlight the importance of
prevention efforts that aim to reduce activ e suicidal ideation in order to
prevent actual suicide attempts.
The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (Joiner , 2005) is one modern da y theory
of suicide that has been empirically supported in y oung African Americans
(Davidson, Wingate, Slish, and R asmussen, 2010; Hollingsworth, Wingate,
Tucker, O'Keefe, & Cole, 2016; T omek, Burton, Hooper , Bolland, & Bolland,
2018). Joiner (2005) posits that th warted belongingness and perceiv ed
burdensomeness must co-occur in order for an individual to dev elop activ e
suicidal ideation. Th warted belongingness occurs when an individual feels a
need to belong, but this need is unmet due to experiencing social isolation
from v alued groups, including family and friends. P erceiv ed burdensomeness
is the perception that one's existence is a burden to others. The
Interpersonal Theory further proposes that th warted belongingness and
perceiv ed burdensomeness will only lead to activ e suicidal ideation when
there is hopelessness regarding these two states, or the belief that these
two states will not impro ve (Hagan, P odlogar , Chu, & Joiner , 2015; V an
Orden et al. , 2010). From a positiv e psy chological perspectiv e, hope has
been posited to protect against the dev elopment of activ e suicidal ideation
when th warted belongingness and perceiv ed burdensomeness are present
(Hollingsworth et al. , 2016; Wingate et al. , 2006). Hope and hopelessness
are not simply opposite ends of one dimension (Grew al & P orter, 2007).
In addition, low -resourced, urban African American y outh often contend with
additiv e socio-ecological stressors, namely po verty and systemic r acism,
that can lead to heightened suicide risk. Howev er, there is empirical
evidence that adaptiv e coping str ategies can protect against suicide risk b y
reducing hopelessness (Barrett, Sonderegger , & Sonderegger , 2001; Gillhamet al., 2012) and suicidal ideation (R obinson et al. , 2016; Thompson, Eggert,
Randell, & Pik e, 2001), and b y increasing hope (Kirschman, R oberts,
Shadlow , & Pelley, 2010).
There are v ery few empirically tested and effectiv e suicide prev ention
interv entions, designed specifically for African American y outh (Goldston et
al., 2008; W ong, Maffini, & Shin, 2014). This is despite growing support for
the importance of cultur ally-grounded interv entions, particularly for the
prevention of adolescent suicide (Bry ant & Harder , 2008; Joe, Canetto , &
Romer, 2008; Lauricella, V aldez, Okamoto , Helm, & Z aremba, 2016). The
complexit y and sensitivit y of suicide prev ention with African American y outh
renders cultur ally-grounded suicide prev ention interv entions especially
important for these y outh (Goldston et al. , 2008; W alker, Lester , & Joe,
2006)
The Adapted-Coping with Stress Course (A-CWS ) is a 15-session school-
based, cultur ally-grounded coping skills interv ention designed specifically for
African American adolescents. The A-CWS  has r aised adaptiv e coping
(Robinson, Droege, Case & Jason, 2015) and evidenced a relativ e risk
reduction of 86% for suicide among adolescents receiving the interv ention,
compared to standard care control participants (R obinson et al. , 2016). 
School-based health center (SBHC) social work ers are indigenous service
providers within schools and ideal agents of change to sustain school-based
interv entions. This study will tr ain indigenous SBHC social work ers to
implement the A-CWS interv ention and test the effectiv eness of their service
delivery on k ey outcomes of interest. This is a v ery achiev able next step;
other studies report good success in tr aining school personnel to implement,
with fidelit y, school-based mental health interv entions within schools in the
Chicago area (A tkins, Gr aczyk, Fr azier & Abdul- Adil, 2003), as well as other
large urban cities (Cappella et al. , 2012; K ellam et al. , 2008).

 Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
Narrative Study Description
The proposed effectiv eness study of the A-CWS  interv ention will target 9th
grade African American adolescents and emplo y a longitudinal r andomiz ed
controlled design. The A-CWS  interv ention has established efficacy to reduce
suicide risk among African American adolescents.
Participating School Information
Students will be recruited from fiv e-six Chicago area high schools. Each
school has a high enrollment of African American students, and an on-site
school-based health center (SBHC). P articipants recruited will be all ninth
grade students, as well as their parents/legal guardians and teachers. All
participating schools will permit project staff to recruit students,
parents/legal guardians, and teachers, prior to commencement of
recruitment efforts. Project staff will then activ ely recruit in-person at the
schools during student enrollment da ys and report card pick -up da ys, when
parents' presence is required at the schools, as well as during regular school
days. At these times, recruitment letters will be handed to students and
parents/legal guardians at the school.  R ecruitment fly ers/posters will also
be posted in the school. These materials will pro vide information about the
Success o ver Stress interv ention (the A-CWS ), participant incentiv es, and
contact information for project staff . Recruitment documents also will be
mailed to students and parents/legal guardians, as attachments to pack ets
the schools send out to families for student enrollment and as separ ate
mailings b y the project. 
Amendment R22 :  The recruitment flyer will be emailed to caregivers of
ninth-grade students at participating high schools. School administrators at
participating high schools will be asked to share the recruitment flyer
electronically with families via school communication platforms. 
Summary of Informed Consent
This research study will obtain student assent and parent/legal guardian
permission, parent consent, and teacher consent. Informed
consent/permission initially will be obtained b y project staff  in the following
ways; (1) students will tak e forms home to be signed b y their parent/legal
guardian and return them to school; (2) forms will be mailed to the
student's residence with a postage paid return en velope; (3) if parents/legal
guardians do not return forms, they will be personally contacted to discuss
the study and ask for consent/permission; and (4) project staff will activ ely
recruit during student enrollment and report card pick -up da ys, when
parents' presence is required at the schools. Students can participate in the
study without their parents/guardians participating. Both student assent and
parent/legal guardian permission are required for all students before theyare in volved in an y research activities. When students and
parents/guardians complete the assent or permission forms, they will be
asked to complete a tr acking document. They will complete this tr acking
document so that project staff can still follow participants who are no longer
enrolled at participating schools. The tr acking form includes information
about student participants' personal contact information (e.g. , address,
phone number , email address, etc.), parent/guardian contact information,
and contact information for a relativ e/friend o ver 18 y ears old. Informed
consent for teachers will be obtained at a later date during the school y ear,
after school administr ators ha ve helped project staff identif y teachers for
study recruitment. Consent forms will be handed out to teachers in-person
at the school at this time. All informed consent and tr acking documents will
be kept in lock ed and secure project offices. 
This research study will seek to collect follow up data from students who are
no longer enrolled in participating high schools. W e will obtain v erbal
parent/guardian permission for these students to tr avel to a school-based
health center to tak e a follow up assessment. W e have submitted w aiver or
alteration of consent and w aiver of documentation of consent.
Amendment R12: A new parent/guardian permission calling script has been
created. The script very briefly describes the study's purpose and establishes
contact with the parent/guardian to obtain parental permission for their
child's participation. The calling script provides contact information for the
Project Director. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the script also describes
safety precautions that will be taken during home visits.
Amendment R22: We propose that parent/guardian consent,
parent/guardian permission, and student assent now be obtained for two
school years for Cohort 1 follow-up (until the end of the 2023-2024 school
year). We propose that parent/guardian consent, parent/guardian
permission, student assent, and teacher consent now be obtained for three
school years for Cohort 2 (until the end of the 2024-2025 school year).  
Research Design
This study will emplo y a randomiz ed controlled trial to test the effectiv eness
of the A-CWS  interv ention, compared to standard care control condition. The
design of this study will include students who evidence suicidal ideation and
are at some lev el of suicide risk. Students r andomiz ed to either the A-CWS
interv ention or standard care control condition ma y have evidenced some
suicidal ideation, but will not be deemed at imminent risk for suicide. All
students who return assent and parent/guardian permission will receiv e a
screener health assessment, which will assess suicide risk. If a student
scores high on critical items, that student will be referred to and connected
to the SBHC. F or students who are referred to the SBHC for additional
follow -up and care, this care will occur at the school following school
procedures and policies. The SBHC will mak e determinations about t ype and
duration of care to be pro vided. In some cases, the SBHC ma y determine
that services should be pro vided b y outside entities (e.g. , hospitals,
communit y mental health clinics). The role of the project team will be to
refer students who score high on critical items to the SBHC. The projectteam will not be in volved in making determinations about care to pro vide or
in pro viding these services. The SBHC will mak e the decision whether to
contact the student's parent/guardian based on school policy .
After participants complete the combined screening  and pre-interv ention
assessment, for each participant continuing in the research, their
parent/guardian, and their primary teacher will complete a baseline
assessment. The student assessments will occur at students' schools, during
a non-instructional period, and parent/guardian assessments will occur in
schools, their homes, or other jointly acceptable v enues b y trained project
assessors. T eacher assessments will occur at the students' schools, during a
non-instructional period. The parent/guardian who is most familiar with the
adolescent, as reported b y the parents/guardians, will be interviewed. If
multiple parents/guardians report knowing the adolescent equally well, we
will ask that they choose who will be interviewed. P er child, only one
parent/guardian will participate, and their relationship to the adolescent will
be documented. All assessments will computeriz ed, using laptop computers.
A combination of interviewer -administered and self -administered measures
will be used to assess sensitiv e domains and questions, using computer
aided self - interview methodology . For expediency , project staff ma y audio
record each item of the surv ey. If needed, participants will then be able to
listen to and read each item as they respond. Interviewer -administered and
self-administered combined methodology is beneficial because: 1) responses
are not constr ained b y reading abilit y, 2) rapport is enhanced and participant
burden reduced when interviewers administer non-sensitiv e questions, and
3) honest y is increased and priv acy protected when A udio-CA SI methods are
used for sensitiv e questions. Each participant ma y terminate from the study
at any time, without penalt y from research or school staff . Each participant
will be giv en a code number and only that number will displa y in the
electronic data files, to protect the participants' confidentialit y. To link data,
the PI, Co- Is, PD , and data manager will k eep a master list of participant
ID/code numbers, b y name, in a lock ed and secure place. 
Amendment R22: We are proposing that there only be one pre-intervention
assessment, which will be called “baseline.” We will no longer be screening
prior to baseline. However, the baseline will assess suicide risk. If students
are deemed to be at elevated suicide risk on the baseline, they will be
referred to the school-based health center (SBHC) for follow-up assessment
to determine eligibility for the study. We also will refer students to the SBHC
at the immediate post-intervention assessment, 6-months post-intervention 
assessment, and 12-months post-intervention assessment, if the student is
determined to be at elevated suicide risk on any of those assessments. We
will refer students to the SBHC at those time-points, if needed, to determine
continuation in the study. 
Amendment R22: We are revising our study procedures as indicated in
Incident Report Determination (dated 07/07/22), to prevent students 18
years of age or older from being inadvertently enrolled in the study. Before
students complete the child baseline measures, a Success Over Stress (SOS)
personnel will verbally ask students if they are 18 years of age or older. Any
student who provides a response indicating they are 18 years of age or older
will not be permitted to compete the baseline assessments and they will bewithdrawn from the SOS study. An SOS personnel will immediately review
the child baseline measures when they are completed by a student, as an
additional preventive step, to determine if they indicated they are 18 years
of age or older. Any student who provides a response on the child baseline
measures indicating they are 18 years of age or older will not be permitted
to continue with the SOS study.  
Randomization
Following the completion of the baseline assessment, student participants
will be r andomiz ed into either the A-CWS  interv ention or standard care
control conditions. The unit of r andomization will be the individual student
and students will be r andomiz ed within schools, at the school lev el and not
the classroom lev el. Student participants will be recruited from
predominantly African American high schools, with 9th through 12th
grades.  Each school has an on-site SBHC and school mental health
professionals, such as social work ers and psy chologists.
Summary of Random Assignment and Assessment Procedures.
Following the baseline assessment, students who are not at imminent
suicide risk will be r andomiz ed into either the A-CWS  interv ention or
standard care control condition. 
Randomization Procedures.  Students will be r andomly assigned to a
condition, and each condition will ha ve the same number of students. A list
of treatment designations (i.e. , treatment A, treatment B) will be created,
with equal numbers of each treatment designation, to ensure that each
participant has an equal opportunit y to be in the treatment or control
condition. A r andom number gener ator will be used to create r andom
numbers equal to the number of participants to be r andomiz ed. The r andom
numbers will then be paired with the treatment designation list, and sorted
in ascending order to create the r andom assignment list. The r andom
assignment list of treatment designations will then be paired with the
participants list. The r andomization process should negate the influence of
outside v ariables, such as receiving medication, additional psy chological
interv entions, prior diagnoses, genetic or inheritable factors, etc. Students
will not be r andomly assigned based on these outside v ariables. In addition,
baseline char acteristics for A-CWS  interv ention and standard care control
conditions will be examined. Significant differences on an y variables will be
noted, and v ariables will be used as co variates in subsequent analyses.
Once students are r andomly assigned to a condition, those participants in
the A-CWS  condition will be assigned to an interv ention group
(approiamately 8-10 students). R andom assignment to interv ention group
will occur using a similar procedure to that used to r andomly assign
participants to conditions. Multiple interv ention groups will occur at each
school simultaneously . The total number of students r andomly assigned to
the A-CWS  condition will be divided b y the number of participants per group
(8-10 participants) to determine the number of groups required at each
school. A list of group designations (e.g. , group A, group B , group C) will be
created, to include ev en numbers of students in each group . A list of r andom
numbers will be gener ated, and will be paired with the list of groupdesignations. This list will be sorted in ascending order , and paired with the
list of students in the A-CWS  condition to determine interv ention group
membership . Students will remain in their assigned interv ention group for
the dur ation of the interv ention.
A-CWS  Intervention
Robinson's cultur ally adapted coping with stress course ( A-CWS ) is a 15-
session, cognitiv e-beha vioral group interv ention designed to dev elop and
enhance African American y ouths' skills to adaptiv ely  cope with stress,
using standard cognitiv e-beha vioral strategies such as relaxation tr aining
and cognitiv e restructuring. Emphasis is giv en to the identification of
individual and contextual factors associated with suicide risk and the unique
day-to-da y experiences of the y outh, pro viding options for adaptiv e coping
(e.g., positiv e thinking) that are cultur ally consistent. The A-CWS  is
structured and manualiz ed to allow its tr ansportabilit y to service pro viders
working in similar en vironments with similar y outh. The first session of the
A-CWS  focuses on establishing r apport and solidif ying participants'
understanding of what the group sessions will be about and wh y. Using
developmentally appropriate language and visual aids, the participants are
acquainted with the construct of stress:  its causes, consequences, and
relation to maladaptiv e thoughts and beha viors. Subsequent sessions
emplo y both cognitiv e and beha vioral approaches to increase adaptiv e
strategies to cope with stress and the gener al management of stress.
Examples of cognitiv e-beha vioral skills related to adaptiv e coping include
relaxation tr aining and cognitiv e refr aming for modif ying maladaptiv e
thoughts. P articipants engage in role-pla ying ex ercises and guided imagery
to bolster their management of frustr ation and dev elopment of greater
internal locus of control. Additionally , stress inoculation techniques are
included to help prepare y outh to anticipate and manage future stress on
their own, after the group sessions end.  R ecognizing the magnitude of the
socio-ecological stressors that the y outh encounter (e.g. , systemic r acism),
the A-CWS  incorpor ates opportunities for the y outh to acquire adaptiv e
coping skills for external circumstances bey ond their control, par alleling their
life experiences. The A-CWS  focuses on connecting emotions to life
experiences, and the capacit y to correctly recogniz e and distinguish one's
emotions.  In addition, sessions are less reliant on tr aditional reading and
writing skills; the A-CWS  incorpor ates alternativ e methods (e.g. , visual and
student -centered instructional methods) to con vey material to students.
Implementation Procedures for Intervention Sessions.  The A-CWS
interv ention sessions will occur at students' schools, with 8-10 students per
group . Interv ention implementation will occur from January -May, during the
9th gr ade academic y ear for each of the two Cohorts. F or this effectiv eness
trial, we will use procedures and conditions similar to our prior efficacy trial,
with the ex ception that R ush social work ers indigenous to the school system
will implement the A-CWS  (i.e., the interv ention social work ers), r ather than
implementation b y research staff . Interv ention groups will meet once-twice
per week, in an a vailable room at the school. The session format includes a
review of the prior week's topic and home activit y, inter active discussions of
the session topic, beha vioral group activities, and assignment of home
activit y. Session attendance will be recorded. Students will be followed eachpost-baseline assessment point, regardless of their session attendance
record, to permit a dose-response analysis and an intent to treat analyses.
To help defr ay costs associated with participation, each school and each
SBHC will be giv en a y early $1,000 stipend.
To ensure that indigenous social work ers are facilitating the A-CWS
interv ention with fidelit y, multiple str ategies will be used. This study will (a)
use treatment manuals, (b) supervise interv ention agents (i.e. , the
interv ention social work ers), and (c) monitor adherence to protocol to
ensure interv ention fidelit y. Before the start of interv ention sessions, PI
Robinson will tr ain the interv ention social work ers (i.e. , session b y session of
the A-CWS  Leader's Manual, until they meet criterion for each session).
During the implementation phase of the study , the interv ention social
workers will meet weekly with R obinson for supervision, feedback and
debriefing, and booster tr ainings as needed. T o assess whether interv ention
sessions are conducted according to the A-CWS  manualiz ed protocol and to
determine when and how to booster the interv ention social work ers (i.e. , to
prevent them from drifting from protocol), 30% of all sessions will be
randomly selected for direct observ ation. The sessions selected for
observ ation will be r ated b y two senior project staff . To prev ent rater drift,
raters will meet periodically with PI R obinson to discuss observ ational
ratings. In order to establish and maintain inter -rater reliabilit y, Robinson
will tr ain the r aters and recalibr ate the r aters when drift is evidenced in her
periodic meetings with r aters. W e will monitor fidelit y using Clark e's (1998)
10-item fidelit y rating scale.
Standard Care Control Condition
The A-CWS  has demonstr ated moder ate effect siz es, when tested against
standard care. Standard care is selected again as the control condition, as
opposed to alternativ e controls, such as attention placebo control, for
several reasons. First, for ethical reasons, we w ant to guard against undue
research exploitation and ensure that all students who might benefit from
services receiv e care.
Second, the standard care control condition reflects services that students in
the SBHC schools would receiv e if the A-CWS  interv ention did not exist,
allowing us to differentially examine the effect of the A-CWS  on the
outcomes of interest, relativ e to customary and “standard care”
interv entions students would otherwise receiv e. This comparison allows the
most gener alizable statement as to the impact of the A-CWS .  Lastly , the
standard care control option renders this study less costly and more feasible.
Students meeting criteria for study inclusion and r andomiz ed into the
standard care condition will be referred to the SBHC mental health pro vider
for case management and this pro vider will not be the interv ention social
worker. The research team will not be in volved in an y treatment decisions or
implementation, unless the student is in crisis and would be endangered
without crisis interv ention b y the research clinicians. Standard care ma y
range from (1) brief interv ention b y the SBHC mental health pro vider to (2)
outside referr al to local communit y service pro viders; these determinations
will be made b y the SBHC mental health team. While the research team willnot interv ene in the standard care condition, we will monitor t ype and
duration of health services receiv ed by these y ouths, for examination as a
potential contributor to outcome.
Follow-Up Assessments
Following the implementation of the A-CWS  interv ention, all student
participants, regardless of study condition, will be assessed an additional
three times: 1) immediately post -interv ention, 2) 6 months following the
interv ention, and 3) 12-months following the interv ention. A t these
assessment points, parent/guardians and primary teachers of student
participants ma y also be assessed. These assessments will use procedures
described abo ve. Teachers will complete assessments about some of their
students that are participating in the study . Teacher assessments will tak e
15-30 minutes to complete per student, and the teachers will return
completed assessments to project staff at their school when they are
finished. 
Frequency and Duration of Participation
Student participants who continue in the study bey ond the screener (i.e. ,
randomiz ed, and complete all follow -up assessments), will be in volved in the
study for appro ximately two y ears (i.e. , from the beginning of freshman y ear
to end of sophomore y ear). Each participant will tak e each assessment only
once. Screener , baseline, post -interv ention, and follow -up assessments will
take appro ximately 30-45 minutes to complete. P articipating
parents/guardians and primary teachers also ma y complete four
assessments, following the timeline described abo ve. Parent/guardian
assessments will tak e appro ximately 30-60 minutes to complete. T eacher
assessments will tak e appro ximately 15-30 minutes to complete per
student.

Other Data
In addition to the data collected from student participants, their
parent/guardian, and primary teacher , school record data will be collected
for each student. W e will collect information from each student participants'
school record about their gr ades, attendance, standardiz ed test scores,
number of detentions, and number of suspensions, as detailed in the assent
and permission forms. P articipant school record data will be collected four
times, corresponding with the completion of the surv ey assessments (i.e. ,
baseline, immediately post -interv ention, 6 months following the
interv ention, 12 months following the interv ention). Ov erall, school record
data will be abstr acted four times o ver the 2- year period. R esearchers will
not access school records directly , school record data will be pro vided b y the
district. 
Data Analysis
To test Specific Aim 1, we will use latent growth modeling. W e will examine
the normativ e growth of activ e suicidal ideation in the standard care control
sample, then compare that growth to the growth of the A-CWS  interv ention
sample. Differences between these growth factors, as indicated b y a
treatment growth factor in the A-CWS  interv ention sample, will indicate
treatment effects for activ e suicidal ideation.
To test Specific Aim 2, we will use latent growth modeling and structur al
equation modeling. T o determine the A-CWS  interv ention's effect on
adaptiv e coping, we will use procedures similar to those detailed for Specific
Aim 1. T o examine the mechanism b y which the A-CWS  interv ention reduces
suicide risk, we will use a mediated moder ation structur al equation model.
In this model, we will examine both direct and indirect effects of the A-CWS
interv ention on activ e suicidal ideation.
To test Specific Aim 3, two tr ained project staff will observ e 30% of all
interv ention sessions. Independent r aters will r ate fidelit y on the F acilitator
Compliance r ating F orm, and inter -rater reliabilit y will be calculated. R ates of
fidelit y meeting or ex ceeding 90% will establish that indigenous social
workers can implement the A-CWS  interv ention with fidelit y.
To test Specific Aim 4, we will use structur al equation modeling. W e will
examine the direct effects of th warted belongingness, perceiv ed
burdensomeness, and socio-ecological factors on activ e suicidal ideation. 
Changes from Amendment #7: 1Revise Full App, 7 of 19 consent docs, all 5
recruit docs to add Project Director Paige Nichol's contact information, and
asking for student email instead of student phone number in accordance
with CPS policy.
The following changes are requested in Amendment #8 : We are requesting
that the total number of subjects to recruit be increased to 2372.  W e are
requesting that the number of parents/guardians to recruit be increased to1160. Gender breakdown will therefore be 1186 females and 1186 males.
Amendment R22. We are proposing a new way for students in the A-CWS
condition in Cohort 1 to participate in the study. Specifically, we are
proposing that these students participate in a mock session of the A-CWS
intervention, in which they pretend to participate in the intervention. This
mock session will be video-recorded and the video-recording may be used
for other purposes, such as presenting at a research conference or sharing
about the research project with media outlets. 
Amendment R41: We propose that a third cohort (Cohort 3) of participating
students, parents/legal guardians, and teachers be recruited and enrolled in
the research study at participating high schools.
Amendment R67: This amendment proposes providing up to five A-CWS
intervention booster sessions during the 2024-2025 school year with Cohort
3 students. Only Cohort 3 students in the A-CWS intervention condition will
be offered booster sessions. The booster sessions will summarize and review
content from A-CWS intervention sessions provided during the 2023-2024
school year. For Cohort 3 students who already participated in 10 or more A-
CWS sessions during the 2023-2024 school year, we propose obtaining
parent/guardian permission and student assent for student participation in
the booster sessions. We propose providing students $7 for returning their
signed parent/guardian permission addendum form. For Cohort 3 students
who participated in less than 10 A-CWS sessions during the 2023-2024
school year, we propose that parent/guardian permission and student assent
for the booster sessions is already covered under the parent/guardian
permission and student assent originally provided for participation in the
research.","and Analytical Technique

Evaluation Study Design
This study will ev aluate the implementation of the new platform across three
disciplines; Biology , Human Geogr aphy, and Language and Composition.
Eight teachers per discipline will be recruited to participate in the study .
Ideally , the teachers will be in different districts to pro vide demogr aphic and
geogr aphic representation. Achiev e has been tested and refined for the
Higher Education space. Insights gleaned from this study will be used to
identif y implementation trends for High School teachers, to test impact of
the platform on student outcomes, to optimiz e the experience for High
School, and to v alidate assumptions about the platform learning model.
Study Sample
This study will attempt to recruit 24 teachers (8 per discipline) and 600
students from different schools and districts. P otential teachers will be sent
an email introducing the study , and asking them to complete an interest
survey if they would lik e to learn more. Once a teacher completes an
interest surv ey, a product demonstr ation of the platform and research
overview session will be scheduled. During that session, teachers will w atch
a brief demonstr ation of the platform in beta form and learn about the study
goals, responsibilities, and benefits. If instructors are interested in
participating, they will be ask ed to complete an informed consent
document.  The Macmillan/BFW research team will also apply for IRB at their
district.
Each participating teacher will be ask ed to send home a parental consent
document for each student in their class(es).  The parental consent
document can be signed digitally (through a link to the digital informed
consent in Alchemer) or via paper . If parents choose to sign the form via
paper , the document will need to be scanned b y the parent and emailed to
the principal in vestigator . The parental consent document will need to be
signed to collect class gr ades and AP scores from students, as well as to
invite students to complete two surv eys about their perceptions of the
platform. P articipation in the study and an y data collection ev ent is
completely v oluntary and there is no penalt y for students that do not
participate.
The final sample siz e will be dependent on the number of teachers and
students that v olunteer to participate in the study . Our goal with the final
sample will be to engage with teachers and students from different
educational segments (siz e and t ype of district, demogr aphics of district and
schools, demogr aphics of teacher and student sample) and teacher user
segment (acceptance of technology , experience with digital products,
experience teaching) to understand more gener ally how teachers and
students are using and experiencing the platform.Active Informed Consent
District consent . Prior to beginning the study we will apply for IRB with each
participating district/school. 
Teacher informed consent.  All teachers will pro vide activ e informed consent.
Student & Parent informed consent . All students will be required to ha ve
their parent or legal guardian complete a parental permission form in order
to participate.
Data Analyses
Data analysis techniques for this study will include descriptiv e and
correlational analyses. Descriptiv e methods will be used to describe progr am
implementation and teacher/student perceptions of the progr am.
Correlations will be used to examine the relationship between progr am
implementation and student learning, student engagement in the platform,
and student satisfaction with the course. Data will be disaggregated b y use
case and educational en vironment to look at trends in outcomes b y use case
and en vironment. Assignment, course, and assessment gr ades will be used
to measure learning outcomes.
Risks and Benefits of Participation

Data Collection Methodology
Quantitativ e and qualitativ e data will be collected from teachers and
students o ver the course of the school y ear at v arious time points.
Student pre-survey . Within the first two weeks of the y ear, students will be
asked to complete a surv ey that captures information on self -reported:
●      basic demogr aphics (language spok en at home, optional question on
student r ace/ethnicit y),
●      experience, perception, and lev el of comfort using digital learning
tools,
●      perception of specific discipline course,
●      motiv ation,
●      and classroom activit y challenges.
Teacher pre-survey . Within the first two weeks of the school y ear, teachers
will be ask ed to complete a surv ey that captures information on:
●      background and experience teaching in high school and the specific
discipline course,
●      time spent preparing for class instruction,
●      experience with, comfort using, and perception of digital learning tools,
●       current challenges with classroom activities,
●      expected implementation of the platform and other digital learning
tools in use,
●      and their expectations of the platform.
Teacher bi-weekly log . Every other Frida y teachers will be ask ed to complete
a bi-weekly log asking them to document the prior two week’ s:
●      implementation of the platform,
●      their perception of the platform (i.e. , satisfaction),
●      their perception of ease of use,
●      and an y benefits or challenges they experienced when using the tool.Teacher interviews . Each teacher will be interviewed once, around the mid-
year point. Interview questions will include probes about implementation,
perception of effectiv eness, and probes specific to that teacher based on
responses to his or her baseline surv ey.
Student Post-Survey . In the last two weeks of the semester , students will be
asked to complete a surv ey that asks fiv e sets of items par allel to the pre-
survey around:
●      perception of and comfort with technology ,
●      perception of the platform (i.e. , satisfaction, ease of use),
●       perception of and comfort with the discipline course being studied,
●      and motiv ation.
The post -survey will also ask about perception of the course and specifically
about the h ypothesiz ed value propositions of the digital learning tool used.
Teacher Post-Survey . In the last two weeks of the semester , teachers will be

College-going has become far and a way the predominant post -secondary
plan for Chicago Public Schools (CPS) gr aduates, man y of whom are first -
gener ation college students of color . In turn, CPS has sought to mak e
opportunities for its students to tak e college-lev el courses more equitable.
These courses are intended to better prepare students for college b y
exposing them to college-lev el curriculum and helping them earn college
credits before gr aduating from high school so that they ma y be able to
complete their degrees sooner .
UChicago Consortium has been in vestigating CPS students’ enrollment in
dual enrollment and dual credit courses to understand which students and
high schools are participating, how man y credits are being earned, and
where these students are enrolling in college.
The proposed study examines how three different t ypes of Early College
Coursework (dual credit, dual enrollment, and AP) shape students'
experiences and influence their thinking with respect to postsecondary
options. Through qualitativ e interviews and focus groups with high school
students, their college/academic advisors, school leaders, and

This qualitativ e research study is guided b y the following research questions:
1. What factors and information influence high school students’ decision to

subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Dual enrollment and dual credit progr ams ha ve been found to be strongly
associated with higher college enrollment and completion r ates, particularly
for students from low -income backgrounds (Fink, Jenkins, & Y anagiur a,
2017; K arp & Hughes 2008; An 2012; K arp et al. 2007; Struhl & V argas,
2012; Y oung, Jo yner, & Slate 2013).The evidence around the of enrollment
in AP courses has been mix ed, with some finding impact on postsecondary
outcomes and others finding that dual enrollment and dual credit str ategies
being more effectiv e (Conger , Long, McGhee, 2020; Giani, Alexander , Reyes,
2014; Speroni, 2011).Howev er, despite the prev alence of research on
college-lev el coursework, the methods used r arely address selection effects
into the courses. Further , studies examine the impact of participation across
all students , and the extent to which these different approaches ha ve an
impact on college enrollment, persistence, and performance for students of
different academic backgrounds remains unclear .
 
While CPS has greatly expanded its offerings in AP in schools, it remains
unclear ifstudents who could potentially benefit from the experience are
participating in AP courses. Previous research has demonstr ated that ev en
when AP courses are a vailable, adult guidance and beliefs can mean that
even higher -achieving students of color are less lik ely to participate (Card
Giuliano , 2016; Grissom & R edding, 2016; Hallett & V enegas, 2008;
Solórzano& Ornelas, 2004). By in vestigating the factors that influence
whether students participate in AP and early college, we can pro vide
guidance to CPS and CCC about how to increase enrollment for students who
would benefit.","to Date

View xForm - Research Review Board (RRB) SubmissionPreliminary Results to Date
Preliminary results indicate that schools utiliz e various str ategies to in volve
students in course selection - particularly as it pertains to early college
course opportunities. Despite this, students reported little in volvement in the
enrollment process.
School staff and students report v ery low passing r ates on AP subject
exams, which for some serv es as a deterrent to participation in AP courses.
Students prioritiz e earning college credit o ver other potential benefits of
early college coursework. Most understand that dual credit coursework
presents a much higher probabilit y of earning college credit, and therefore
come to fa vor dual credit courses.
Students' understandings of IHE credit tr ansfer policies are v ariable and
often lacking. Most assume credits will automatically tr ansfer and be applied
to their future progr ams, though few ha ve concrete evidence to support
these claims.

Focus Groups
InterviewsPlease outline your protocol for focus group activities, describing
when, where, duration, frequency, and with whom. 
High school students will be in vited (see description of recruitment
procedures, section 8.0 of this application) to participate in a focus group
with 2-3 other students who are enrolled in the same early college/AP
course t ype at their school. The dur ation of the focus group sessions is
dependent on the school da y schedule; we anticipate focus group session
length of appro ximately 45 minutes. R esearchers will ensure, in scheduling
these sessions, that students do not miss instructional time. Sessions will
take place during the regularly scheduled school da y. Focus group questions
are designed to elicit students' perspectiv es on enrolling in early college
coursework, their course taking experiences, and their plans for
postsecondary education and/or work.
Based on current school district -level policies go verning human subjects
research, focus groups with students shall be conducted online using a
secure video conference platform (Google Meet is the only appro ved video
conference platform for CPS). If guidelines for conducting research with CPS
staff and students change (in light of the COVID pandemic response), we
may pursue in person focus groups/data collection. A t this time, we
anticipate all activities will occur remotely .
CPS also requires that a CPS staff member be present during an y data
collection activities in volving students (see research guidelines attached).
The researchers will request and confirm that an y CPS staff member present
during these sessions is in a non-instructional role and/or is not currently
involved in the implementation of early college courses at the school.

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
College-going has become far and a way the predominant post -secondary
plan for Chicago Public Schools (CPS) gr aduates, man y of whom are first -
gener ation college students of color . In turn, CPS has sought to mak e
opportunities for its students to tak e college-lev el courses more equitable.
These courses are intended to better prepare students for college b y
exposing them to college-lev el curriculum and helping them earn college
credits before gr aduating from high school so that they ma y be able to
complete their degrees sooner .
UChicago Consortium has been in vestigating CPS students’ enrollment in
dual enrollment and dual credit courses to understand which students and
high schools are participating, how man y credits are being earned, and
where these students are enrolling in college.
The proposed study examines how three different t ypes of Early College
Coursework (dual credit, dual enrollment, and AP) shape students'
experiences and influence their thinking with respect to postsecondary
options. Through qualitativ e interviews and focus groups with high school
students, their college/academic advisors, school leaders, and
instructors/facult y of AP , dual enrollment, and dual credit courses, this
study will shed light on factors that influence students' decision making,
enrollment and participation, and outcomes as they relate to early college
coursework.
 
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
This qualitativ e research study is guided b y the following research questions:
1. What factors and information influence high school students’ decision to
enroll in Early College (dual credit and dual enrollment) and AP coursework?
2. How do students conceiv e of Early College and AP learning experiences in
relation to their postsecondary plans? How do their experiences in Early
College and AP coursework differ from those in non- acceler ated or other
courses?
Due to the explor atory nature of the qualitativ e research questions, this
investigation does not aim to test or maintain a priori h ypotheses.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Dual enrollment and dual credit progr ams ha ve been found to be strongly
associated with higher college enrollment and completion r ates, particularly
for students from low -income backgrounds (Fink, Jenkins, & Y anagiur a,
2017; K arp & Hughes 2008; An 2012; K arp et al. 2007; Struhl & V argas,
2012; Y oung, Jo yner, & Slate 2013).The evidence around the of enrollment
in AP courses has been mix ed, with some finding impact on postsecondary
outcomes and others finding that dual enrollment and dual credit str ategies
being more effectiv e (Conger , Long, McGhee, 2020; Giani, Alexander , Reyes,
2014; Speroni, 2011).Howev er, despite the prev alence of research on
college-lev el coursework, the methods used r arely address selection effects
into the courses. Further , studies examine the impact of participation across
all students , and the extent to which these different approaches ha ve an
impact on college enrollment, persistence, and performance for students of
different academic backgrounds remains unclear .
 
While CPS has greatly expanded its offerings in AP in schools, it remains
unclear ifstudents who could potentially benefit from the experience are
participating in AP courses. Previous research has demonstr ated that ev en
when AP courses are a vailable, adult guidance and beliefs can mean that
even higher -achieving students of color are less lik ely to participate (Card
Giuliano , 2016; Grissom & R edding, 2016; Hallett & V enegas, 2008;
Solórzano& Ornelas, 2004). By in vestigating the factors that influence
whether students participate in AP and early college, we can pro vide
guidance to CPS and CCC about how to increase enrollment for students who
would benefit.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
This study in volves participants from fiv e different groups associated with
Early College and AP coursework, including:
-CPS high school students enrolled in dual enrollment, dual credit, or AP
courses at 3 participating high schools
-academic advisors/""school counselors"" from 3 participating CPS high
schools
-teachers/instructors of AP and dual credit courses from 3 participating CPS
high schools
-school leaders from 3 participating CPS high schools
-progr am coordinators/academic advisors at Cit y Colleges of Chicago
FOR ALL P ARTICIP ANT GROUPS:
No experimental interv entions or tasks are associated with participation in
this study .
Audio from the interviews/focus groups will be digitally recorded, with
participants' consent. Individuals can elect to skip or decline an y questions
asked of them. They ma y also discontinue their participation at an y time.
Individuals ma y request that the audio recorder be shut off for an y section
of their interview/focus group; they are also reminded that their data are
solely utiliz ed for research purposes, are stored confidentially , and that their
personal identif ying information is not shared as part of an y report or
presentation of findings.
After the interviews/focus groups, participants will retain contact
information for the principal in vestigator and the UChicago institutional
review board. They are encour aged to contact IRB or the researcher with
any questions or concerns that arise following participation.
There are no expectations of subsequent in volvement b y research
participants bey ond the interview/focus group sessions.
PROCEDURES FOR STUDENT S:
High school students will be in vited (see description of recruitment
procedures, section 8.0 of this application) to participate in a focus group
with 2-3 other students who are enrolled in the same early college/AP
course t ype at their school. The dur ation of the focus group sessions is

motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Internalizing problems, such as anxiet y and depression symptoms, increase sharply
across adolescence and represent the most commonly diagnosed disorders during
this dev elopmental period (K essler et al. , 2005; Merikangas et al. , 2010).Notably ,
Black and Latino y outh who reside in urban communities are at heightened risk for
these mental health challenges (e.g. , anxiet y, depression, suicide; Canino &
Roberts, 2001; Joe et al. , 2006, K ennard et al. , 2006). Implementing prev ention
and interv ention progr ams within a school setting allows for a natur al and
convenient deliv ery of services, helps foster a strong peer and social support
system, and reduces the potential stigma associated with the acquisition of mental
health services at home or elsewhere (Calear & Christensen, 2009; P aternite,
2005). Further , schools are a k ey resource for identif ying those suffering from
mental health problems, as well as a place for prev enting disorders and fostering
students’ personal dev elopment and well-being (Z enner et al. , 2014).The Unified
Protocols for T ransdiagnostic T reatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents (UP-
A; Ehrenreich-Ma y et al, 2018) is one such progr am that ma y be well-suited for
delivery in urban, div erse school settings. The UP- A addresses a broad r ange of
emotional symptoms in y outh ages 13-17 y ears old and tak es a tr ansdiagnostic
approach b y focusing on a set of core skills and evidence-based techniques (e.g. ,
preventing emotional a voidance, enhancing cognitiv e flexibilit y, and changing
maladaptiv e beha viors) and applying these skills across a r ange of emotional
disorder presentations, including anxiet y and depression symptoms (Ehrenreich-Ma y
et al., 2017, 2018). Such interv entions ha ve the potential to significantly impro ve
mental health outcomes for those who ma y otherwise not ha ve opportunities for
services. In addition to the clear need to better understand the efficacy of the UP- A
in reducing internalizing symptoms and engagement of tr ansdiagnostic target
mechanisms, it is necessary to examine how urban schools could implement
preventive interv ention services (e.g. , an adapted v ersion of the UP- A) sustainably .
Understanding the attitudes of the school staff (i.e. , teachers, counselors, nurses,
social work ers, and administr ators) and their potential for pro viding informal and
formal support to students in need is crucial to implementing sustainable
progr amming (Spence et al. , 2003, 2005).The current study proposes to extend
transdiagnostic prev ention research for adolescents at high-risk for internalizing
disorders b y conducting an open trial to ev aluate the use of the UP- A as an adapted
and targeted group-based anxiet y and depression prev entive interv ention in a high
school setting. Thus, the centr al aim of the present study is to expand this work b y
examining pre, post, and one-month follow -up outcomes associated with the use of
the UP- A adapted as a group-based anxiet y and depression prev entive interv ention
in a Chicago Public High School among predominantly low -income Black and Latino
students experiencing elev ated depression or anxiet y symptoms. W e hypothesiz e
that anxiet y and depression symptoms will decrease from pre- to post -interv ention
and be sustained at the one-month follow -up.
 The study ma y also pro vide a peer -supported component of the interv ention
wherein students in the group will receiv e a ""buddy"" at the beginning of treatment
to help be a point of social contact to pro vide mutual support regarding attendance,
scheduling meaningful activities, and completing between session pr actice as these
emerged as barriers to treatment adherence and are domains where mutual peer
support ma y be most salient giv en clinician limitations to attend to out of session
activities.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The current study proposes to extend tr ansdiagnostic prev ention research for
adolescents at high-risk for internalizing disorders b y conducting an open trial to
evaluate the use of the UP- A as an adapted and targeted group-based anxiet y and
depression prev entive interv ention in a high school setting with an intended peer
support enhancement to increase treatment adherence. Despite support for the UP-
A as a promising univ ersal, school-based prev ention progr am in Spain (García-
Escaler a et al. , 2017), the UP- A has not been ev aluated as a targeted prev entive
interv ention for predominantly low -income Black and Latino adolescents within
urban schools in the United States. Thus, the centr al aim of the present study is to
expand this work b y examining pre, post, and one-month follow -up outcomes
associated with the use of the UP- A adapted as a group-based anxiet y and
depression prev entive interv ention in a Chicago Public High School among
predominantly low -income Black and Latino students experiencing elev ated
depression or anxiet y symptoms. W e hypothesiz e that anxiet y and depression
symptoms will decrease from pre- to post -interv ention and be sustained at the one-
month follow -up. Further , consistent with prior liter ature (Ialongo et al. , 1999;
Wolchik et al. , 1993), it is h ypothesiz ed that there will be significant increases in
emotion regulation skills and gener al emotional insight.
By adding a ""buddy"" component to increase treatment adherence in the study we
hope to further impro ve treatment outcomes for those receiving the treatment
given that mutual peer support can help with reducing stigma and y outh ha ve
unique insights into barriers other y outh their age face to completing care activities
and attending sessions. W e aim to ev aluate if this addition will be associated with
impro ved outcomes students in the study and to understand how increased lev erage
of social connectedness in research-communit y partnerships influences the
feasibilit y, acceptabilit y, and future of mental health interv ention implementation in
this communit y partnership . We hypothesiz e that there will be benefits to the
wellbeing of students in the progr am giv en that in the first phase of this study ,
students indicated that ha ving the group based format made them feel closer to
peers, reduced stigma, and made them feel less alone in their expeirences. 
In addition to the quantitativ e evaluation of the open trial, the proposed study aims
to conduct focus-group discussions with v arious school staff members, including
teachers, mental health counselors, deans, and the assistant principal, to capture

What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build
upon the body of extant knowledge?
School-Based Interventions for Minoritized Youth
Internalizing problems, such as anxiet y and depression symptoms, increase sharply
across adolescence and represent the most commonly diagnosed disorders during
this dev elopmental period (K essler et al. , 2005; Merikangas et al. , 2010).
Additionally , they lead to significant impairment and ha ve adv erse consequences on
adolescent dev elopment, including increased risk of drug and alcohol abuse, risky
sexual beha vior, poor academic outcomes, impaired social relationships, suicide,
and ph ysical health problems (Birmaher et al. , 1996; K essler et al. , 2001; Copeland
et al., 2014). Further , these disorders are highly comorbid (Garber & W eersing,
2010) and the emergence of depression and anxiet y symptoms during adolescence
is particularly concerning as early -onset is associated with recurrent anxiet y and
depressiv e episodes in adulthood (Garber et al. , 1988; Pine et al. , 1998). Moreo ver,
even youth with subclinical lev els of depression and anxiet y symptoms experience
significant impairment, as subclinical symptoms predict later disorders (K ovac &
Lopez -Duran, 2010; Pine, 2007) and are associated with other negativ e outcomes
such as low school gr ades and decreased lik elihood of school completion (Riglin et
al., 2014).
Notably , Black and Latino y outh who reside in urban communities are at heightened
risk for these mental health challenges (e.g. , anxiet y, depression, suicide; Canino &
Roberts, 2001; Joe et al. , 2006, K ennard et al. , 2006). Studies show that a k ey
contributor to the etiology and maintenance of internalizing disorders in y outh is
persistent po verty and other chronic en vironmental stressors (Gr ant et al. 2006);
Black and Latino y outh are too often exposed to additional stressors including
racism, po verty, communit y violence, limited y outh support resources, and a serious
shortage of mental health services (K ennard et al. , 2006). Thus, one promising
approach to address the negativ e outcomes and disease burden associated with
internalizing disorders among minorit y youth is through prev entive interv entions
(i.e., addressing symptoms of anxiet y and depression before they dev elop into
clinical diagnoses).
Prevention progr ams can be categoriz ed as either univ ersal or targeted approaches
(Rone & Hoagwood, 2000; Greenberg et al. , 2001). Univ ersal prev ention progr ams
are deliv ered to all individuals within an identified population regardless of risk
(Dowdy et al. , 2014). F or example, univ ersal prev ention progr ams for y outh are
typically deliv ered in the school setting via presentation or curriculum modifications
for ev ery student (e.g. , Neil & Christensen, 2009). Strengths of the univ ersal
interv ention approach include a voiding the stigma of singling out individuals for
treatment, enhancing gener al mental health for a large number of students, and
relativ ely low dropout r ates (Spence et al. , 2003). Howev er, there are some
important limitations of univ ersal prev ention progr ams to consider: they are
resource-intensiv e and ma y not pro vide adequate support to those at the highest
risk (R one & Hoagwood, 2000). Further , a meta- analysis found that univ ersal
preventive interv entions yielded a smaller effect siz e relativ e to targeted prev entive
progr ams for both depression and anxiet y (Reivich et al. , 2005). T argeted
prevention approaches are categoriz ed as either selectiv e (i.e. , directed tow ard
individuals at -risk for the disorder based on established risk factors; Greenberg et
al., 2001) or indicated (i.e. , directed tow ard individuals demonstr ating subclinical
symptoms; Greenberg et al. , 2001). While selectiv e or indicated approaches
typically add time and cost to the recruitment process, as participants must qualif y
through screening, it ensures that those receiving the interv ention are most at -riskg g, g
(Calear & Christensen, 2010).
In addition to using more targeted approaches, tr ansdiagnostic prev entive
interv entions that address clinical lev els of both anxiet y and depression ma y be
most beneficial (Garber & W eersing, 2010) giv en their high lev els of comorbidit y in
adolescents (Cummings et al. , 2014). Further , depression and anxiet y share man y
common vulner ability and maintenance factors (e.g. , neuroticism, poor distress
tolerance, poor emotional regulation skills, and high negativ e affect (Cummings et
al., 2014). Thus, a prev entive interv ention approach that targets underlying risk
factors r ather than only disorder -specific symptoms ma y allow for more efficient
prevention.
Specifically , transdiagnostic approaches in the form of cognitiv e-beha vioral ther apy
(CBT) are designed to address common and complex comorbid symptoms (e.g. ,
Barlow & F archione, 2017; Ehrenreich-Ma y & Chu 2014; Ehrenreich-Ma y et al.
2012; Sherman et al. , 2018). These progr ams target common factors to sev eral
disorders and ma y lead to greater benefits such as impro ving dissemination b y
being more cost -effectiv e as well as addressing challenges a greater number of
youth are experiencing and thus could prev ent a broader r ange of
disorders/symptoms. This ma y be particularly important for prev ention progr am
delivery in the school setting, where time and resources for mental health
prevention are limited (Garcia-Escaler a et al. , 2018, 2020; Doz ois et al. , 2009).
Implementing prev ention progr ams within a school setting allows for a natur al and
convenient deliv ery of services, helps foster a strong peer and social support
system, and reduces the potential stigma associated with the acquisition of mental
health services at home or elsewhere (Calear & Christensen, 2009; P aternite,
2005). Further , schools are a k ey resource for identif ying those suffering from
mental health problems, as well as a place for prev enting disorders and fostering
students’ personal dev elopment and well-being (Z enner et al. , 2014). Within the
school en vironment, teachers, counselors, and other staff are in a unique position to
potentially act as gatek eepers and recogniz e vulner able students and pro vide
support and referr als to appropriate services (Sisask et al. , 2014). Further ,
interv ention in schools ma y help to reduce the disparit y in mental health services
among Black and Latino y outh compared to their white counterparts (Cummings &
Druss, 2011; Merikangas et al. , 2010) b y alleviating man y typical barriers
associated with accessing treatment (e.g. , time, location, and cost; Barrett & P ahl,
2006). Giv en the complexit y of the mental health and social needs of minorit y youth
in urban settings, targeted school-based interv entions are a promising a venue in
preventing mental disorders in higher -risk adolescents.
The Unified Protocols for T ransdiagnostic T reatment of Emotional Disorders in
Adolescents (UP- A; Ehrenreich-Ma y et al, 2018) is one such progr am that ma y be
well-suited for deliv ery in urban, div erse school settings. The UP- A addresses a
broad r ange of emotional symptoms in y outh ages 13-17 y ears old and tak es a
transdiagnostic approach b y focusing on a set of core skills and evidence-based
techniques (e.g. , prev enting emotional a voidance, enhancing cognitiv e flexibilit y,
and changing maladaptiv e beha viors) and applying these skills across a r ange of
emotional disorder presentations, including anxiet y and depression symptoms
(Ehrenreich-Ma y et al. , 2017, 2018). Furthermore, the UP- A has been examined as
a univ ersal prev entive interv ention outside of clinical settings. Specifically , in an
open trial conducted in a summer camp setting (K ennedy et al. , 2019), results
indicated that there were significant decreases in anxiet y from pre- to post -
prevention but no changes in depression symptoms. These results are also
consistent with a study that adapted the UP- A as a univ ersal school-based
prevention progr am (García-Escaler a et al. , 2017) and showed that participation in
the progr am w as associated with modest reductions in anxiet y but no significantresults were observ ed for depression symptoms. An important limitation across
these prior studies is the UP- A was only implemented and examined as a univ ersal
approach outside of clinic settings, and research has y et to examine the UP- A as a
targeted prev entive interv ention. Further , these studies limited their assessment to
changes in anxiet y and depression symptoms r ather than expanding to include
changes in more pro ximal predictors (i.e. , target mechanisms). Moreo ver, few
prevention studies include measures of potential mediators of the relation between
the interv ention and the outcome (Horowitz & Garber , 2006). Giv en that the causes
of internalizing disorders lik ely are multifaceted, prev ention progr ams examining
changes in underlying constructs such as emotion regulation, a wareness of emotion
states, and help-seeking beha viors are important components of determining the
success of the UP- A. Thus, a more comprehensiv e measurement of potential
mechanisms of change is needed to giv e a more complete picture of the effects of a
prevention interv ention ev en if the interv ention does not successfully prev ent
internalizing disorders (Horowitz & Garber , 2006). F or example, studies that
included multiple outcome v ariables found that their progr ams mitigated risk factors
associated with depression, ev en if they showed little or no effect on depression
symptoms (Ialongo et al. , 1999; W olchik et al. , 1993).
Taken together , the current liter ature suggests that targeted, school-based
preventive interv entions are a feasible and effectiv e avenue for deliv ering mental
health services among y outh at risk for internalizing disorders. Such interv entions
have the potential to significantly impro ve mental health outcomes for those who
may otherwise not ha ve opportunities for services. In addition to the clear need to
better understand the efficacy of the UP- A in reducing internalizing symptoms and
engagement of tr ansdiagnostic target mechanisms, it is necessary to examine how
urban schools could implement prev entive interv ention services (e.g. , an adapted
version of the UP- A) sustainably . Understanding the attitudes of the school staff
(i.e., teachers, counselors, nurses, social work ers, and administr ators) and their
potential for pro viding informal and formal support to students in need is crucial to
implementing sustainable progr amming (Spence et al. , 2003, 2005).","to Date

This is a group- based prev ention-interv ention study that will tak e place at
Roosev elt High School, a Chicago Public High School. First, parents/legal guardians
of all student participants will be v erbally consented to the brief phone screen and
will pro vide v erbal consent that a member of the research team can contact their
teen to conduct a similar , brief phone screen. Next, with the parents' permission,
the student will go through the v erbal assent process for a brief phone screen for
eligibilit y for the study . In order to be eligible for the study , students need be a
student at R oosev elt High School and fluent in English. Students also need to report
a total score of 24 or abo ve on the DA SS-Y to screen positiv e. Students and/or
parents who that the student has a history of schiz ophrenia, psy chosis,
developmental disorder (A utism, perv asive dev elopmental disorders) or an y other
condition that requires more immediate or intensiv e treatment will be ex cluded from
this study . If a student is eligible, the student and their parent/guardian will be
invited for a brief baseline assessment, which will occur at the R oosev elt High
School.
At the baseline assessment, we will collect consent and assent regarding the
students' and parents' participation in the prev ention study . Additionally , the
research team will collect consent to access student academic records while the
student in the study and through the academic y ear in order to best ensure we
capture academics during students' time in the progr am. R ecords will be obtained
directly from the student/parent as either a cop y of a report card or self -reported
grades/GP A. This follow -up review of academic records will allow the study team to
assess academic outcomes of students in our progr am and information on school
drop-out, academic probation, gr ade point a verage, and other relev ant mark ers to
examine academic tr ajectory outcomes for student participants in the study . For the
baseline assessment, we will utiliz e self -report questionnaires and
parents/caregiv ers’ questionnaires. Caregiv ers and students will complete three
questionnaire visits: baseline, mid-progr am, and end of progr am. Similar
assessments will be conducted at these three time points and will allow us to
analyz e pre-to-post outcomes associated with the use of the peer -enhanced UP- A
adapted as a school-based anxiet y and depression interv ention. F or each of the
three assessment timepoints, both parents/caregiv ers and the students will
complete the same questionnaires at three time points, and each time point
assessment will tak e appro ximate 20-45 minutes total. During these three time
point assessments, caregiv ers of the treatment recipients will answer questions
about their experiences their child's social, emotion, academic, and mental health
experiences.
The open trial interv ention, UP- A modified, will be deliv ered as a weekly 40-50-min
8 to 9-session school-based targeted prev entive interv ention for adolescents at risk
for depression and anxiet y. Each group session will target one of the UP- A core
modules. An adv anced doctor al student in clinical psy chology (Nellie Shippen, M.A.)
will be implementing the progr am with supervision from a licensed clinical
psychologist (Dr . Meinz er, PhD). Sessions will occur at R oosev elt High School during
the school da y (e.g. , lunch periods or alternating class periods).
In the first session, the intended activ e component is building motiv ation, the
adolescents pro vided their three top problems and a SMAR T (that is, specific,
measur able, attainable, relev ant, and time-bound) goal for each problem.
During the second session (intended as an activ e component for psy choeducation
about
emotions), the adolescents will learn about emotions and their function as well as
what emotional beha viors are. In the third session (intended as an activ ecomponent for beha vioral activ ation ), the adolescents will learn about the cy cle of
avoidance and the meaning of opposite action and beha vioral experiments.
Additionally , students will reflect on their current use of free time and compile a list
of enjo yable activities with which to engage in opposite actions for sadness or
stress. During the fourth session (intended as an activ e component for
psychoeducation about body sensations), the adolescents will learn about ph ysical
sensations associated with emotions and pr actice body scanning relaxation ex ercise.
In the fifth session (intended as an activ e component for cognitiv e restructuring),
the concept of “thinking tr aps” (that is, cognitiv e distortions) and detectiv e thinking
skills (that is, cognitiv e reappr aisal) will be introduced. Additionally , top problems
obtained in session 1 will be re-r ated. The sixth session (intended as activ e
components for cognitiv e restructuring and problem-solving
skills), will be dedicated for the adolescents to review the concept of thinking tr aps
and
detectiv e thinking skills and learned how to o vercome problems using problem-
solving skills. During the sev enth session (intended as activ e components for
present -moment a wareness), the participants will learn about present -moment and
non-judgmental a wareness and pr actice this skill in the session b y focusing on
breathing. In the eighth session (intended as an activ e component for exposure),
the cy cle of a voidance
will be reviewed, the adolescents will be pro vided with psy choeducation about
emotional exposures. Finally , in the ninth session (intended as an activ e component
for relapse prev ention), the adolescents will re-r ate their top problems, review the
strategies learned in the progr am, and create an individualiz ed post -progr am plan
to practice skills.
After the progr am concludes, parents and students will be ask ed to participate in
the brief interview (appro ximately 30 minutes) about their experience in the
progr am, suggestions for impro vement, and gener al thoughts about stress and
sadness as a high school student, which will occur at the student ’s high school or
over the phone. Interviews will be audio-recorded.
Interested R oosev elt High School staff will be consented to participate in pre- and
post- open trial focus groups to modif y and refine the UP- A and discuss implications
for sustainabilit y in the school. F ocus groups with school staff will be recorded and
take place in a priv ate space at R oosev elt High School. The groups are designed to
elicit school staff feedback and input through a group discussion about issues
students face in their classrooms/school, specifically in regard to social and

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the
motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Internalizing problems, such as anxiet y and depression symptoms, increase sharply
across adolescence and represent the most commonly diagnosed disorders during
this dev elopmental period (K essler et al. , 2005; Merikangas et al. , 2010).Notably ,
Black and Latino y outh who reside in urban communities are at heightened risk for
these mental health challenges (e.g. , anxiet y, depression, suicide; Canino &
Roberts, 2001; Joe et al. , 2006, K ennard et al. , 2006). Implementing prev ention
and interv ention progr ams within a school setting allows for a natur al and
convenient deliv ery of services, helps foster a strong peer and social support
system, and reduces the potential stigma associated with the acquisition of mental
health services at home or elsewhere (Calear & Christensen, 2009; P aternite,
2005). Further , schools are a k ey resource for identif ying those suffering from
mental health problems, as well as a place for prev enting disorders and fostering
students’ personal dev elopment and well-being (Z enner et al. , 2014).The Unified
Protocols for T ransdiagnostic T reatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents (UP-
A; Ehrenreich-Ma y et al, 2018) is one such progr am that ma y be well-suited for
delivery in urban, div erse school settings. The UP- A addresses a broad r ange of
emotional symptoms in y outh ages 13-17 y ears old and tak es a tr ansdiagnostic
approach b y focusing on a set of core skills and evidence-based techniques (e.g. ,
preventing emotional a voidance, enhancing cognitiv e flexibilit y, and changing
maladaptiv e beha viors) and applying these skills across a r ange of emotional
disorder presentations, including anxiet y and depression symptoms (Ehrenreich-Ma y
et al., 2017, 2018). Such interv entions ha ve the potential to significantly impro ve
mental health outcomes for those who ma y otherwise not ha ve opportunities for
services. In addition to the clear need to better understand the efficacy of the UP- A
in reducing internalizing symptoms and engagement of tr ansdiagnostic target
mechanisms, it is necessary to examine how urban schools could implement
preventive interv ention services (e.g. , an adapted v ersion of the UP- A) sustainably .
Understanding the attitudes of the school staff (i.e. , teachers, counselors, nurses,
social work ers, and administr ators) and their potential for pro viding informal and
formal support to students in need is crucial to implementing sustainable
progr amming (Spence et al. , 2003, 2005).The current study proposes to extend
transdiagnostic prev ention research for adolescents at high-risk for internalizing
disorders b y conducting an open trial to ev aluate the use of the UP- A as an adapted
and targeted group-based anxiet y and depression prev entive interv ention in a high
school setting. Thus, the centr al aim of the present study is to expand this work b y
examining pre, post, and one-month follow -up outcomes associated with the use of
the UP- A adapted as a group-based anxiet y and depression prev entive interv ention
in a Chicago Public High School among predominantly low -income Black and Latino
students experiencing elev ated depression or anxiet y symptoms. W e hypothesiz e
that anxiet y and depression symptoms will decrease from pre- to post -interv ention
and be sustained at the one-month follow -up.
 The study ma y also pro vide a peer -supported component of the interv ention
wherein students in the group will receiv e a ""buddy"" at the beginning of treatment
to help be a point of social contact to pro vide mutual support regarding attendance,
scheduling meaningful activities, and completing between session pr actice as these
emerged as barriers to treatment adherence and are domains where mutual peer
support ma y be most salient giv en clinician limitations to attend to out of session
activities. Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The current study proposes to extend tr ansdiagnostic prev ention research for
adolescents at high-risk for internalizing disorders b y conducting an open trial to
evaluate the use of the UP- A as an adapted and targeted group-based anxiet y and
depression prev entive interv ention in a high school setting with an intended peer
support enhancement to increase treatment adherence. Despite support for the UP-
A as a promising univ ersal, school-based prev ention progr am in Spain (García-
Escaler a et al. , 2017), the UP- A has not been ev aluated as a targeted prev entive
interv ention for predominantly low -income Black and Latino adolescents within
urban schools in the United States. Thus, the centr al aim of the present study is to
expand this work b y examining pre, post, and one-month follow -up outcomes
associated with the use of the UP- A adapted as a group-based anxiet y and
depression prev entive interv ention in a Chicago Public High School among
predominantly low -income Black and Latino students experiencing elev ated
depression or anxiet y symptoms. W e hypothesiz e that anxiet y and depression
symptoms will decrease from pre- to post -interv ention and be sustained at the one-
month follow -up. Further , consistent with prior liter ature (Ialongo et al. , 1999;
Wolchik et al. , 1993), it is h ypothesiz ed that there will be significant increases in
emotion regulation skills and gener al emotional insight.
By adding a ""buddy"" component to increase treatment adherence in the study we
hope to further impro ve treatment outcomes for those receiving the treatment
given that mutual peer support can help with reducing stigma and y outh ha ve
unique insights into barriers other y outh their age face to completing care activities
and attending sessions. W e aim to ev aluate if this addition will be associated with
impro ved outcomes students in the study and to understand how increased lev erage
of social connectedness in research-communit y partnerships influences the
feasibilit y, acceptabilit y, and future of mental health interv ention implementation in
this communit y partnership . We hypothesiz e that there will be benefits to the
wellbeing of students in the progr am giv en that in the first phase of this study ,
students indicated that ha ving the group based format made them feel closer to
peers, reduced stigma, and made them feel less alone in their expeirences. 
In addition to the quantitativ e evaluation of the open trial, the proposed study aims
to conduct focus-group discussions with v arious school staff members, including
teachers, mental health counselors, deans, and the assistant principal, to capture
the experiences of school staff regarding the mental health needs of their students
and understand the experiences of the students and parents/caregiv ers enrolled in
the progr am in order to adv ance implementation, oper ation, and sustainabilit y of
targeted prev ention progr ams in this population. Lastly , following the prev entive
interv ention, parents/caregiv ers and adolescents will participate in a brief interview
designed to elicit feedback related to the effectiv eness and gener al satisfaction of
the progr am, which will be ev aluated to inform interv ention refinement.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject.
What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build
upon the body of extant knowledge?
School-Based Interventions for Minoritized Youth
Internalizing problems, such as anxiet y and depression symptoms, increase sharply
across adolescence and represent the most commonly diagnosed disorders during
this dev elopmental period (K essler et al. , 2005; Merikangas et al. , 2010).
Additionally , they lead to significant impairment and ha ve adv erse consequences on
adolescent dev elopment, including increased risk of drug and alcohol abuse, risky
sexual beha vior, poor academic outcomes, impaired social relationships, suicide,
and ph ysical health problems (Birmaher et al. , 1996; K essler et al. , 2001; Copeland
et al., 2014). Further , these disorders are highly comorbid (Garber & W eersing,
2010) and the emergence of depression and anxiet y symptoms during adolescence
is particularly concerning as early -onset is associated with recurrent anxiet y and
depressiv e episodes in adulthood (Garber et al. , 1988; Pine et al. , 1998). Moreo ver,
even youth with subclinical lev els of depression and anxiet y symptoms experience
significant impairment, as subclinical symptoms predict later disorders (K ovac &
Lopez -Duran, 2010; Pine, 2007) and are associated with other negativ e outcomes
such as low school gr ades and decreased lik elihood of school completion (Riglin et
al., 2014).
Notably , Black and Latino y outh who reside in urban communities are at heightened
risk for these mental health challenges (e.g. , anxiet y, depression, suicide; Canino &
Roberts, 2001; Joe et al. , 2006, K ennard et al. , 2006). Studies show that a k ey
contributor to the etiology and maintenance of internalizing disorders in y outh is
persistent po verty and other chronic en vironmental stressors (Gr ant et al. 2006);
Black and Latino y outh are too often exposed to additional stressors including
racism, po verty, communit y violence, limited y outh support resources, and a serious
shortage of mental health services (K ennard et al. , 2006). Thus, one promising
approach to address the negativ e outcomes and disease burden associated with
internalizing disorders among minorit y youth is through prev entive interv entions
(i.e., addressing symptoms of anxiet y and depression before they dev elop into
clinical diagnoses).
Prevention progr ams can be categoriz ed as either univ ersal or targeted approaches
(Rone & Hoagwood, 2000; Greenberg et al. , 2001). Univ ersal prev ention progr ams
are deliv ered to all individuals within an identified population regardless of risk
(Dowdy et al. , 2014). F or example, univ ersal prev ention progr ams for y outh are
typically deliv ered in the school setting via presentation or curriculum modifications
for ev ery student (e.g. , Neil & Christensen, 2009). Strengths of the univ ersal
interv ention approach include a voiding the stigma of singling out individuals for
treatment, enhancing gener al mental health for a large number of students, and
relativ ely low dropout r ates (Spence et al. , 2003). Howev er, there are some
important limitations of univ ersal prev ention progr ams to consider: they are
resource-intensiv e and ma y not pro vide adequate support to those at the highest
risk (R one & Hoagwood, 2000). Further , a meta- analysis found that univ ersal
preventive interv entions yielded a smaller effect siz e relativ e to targeted prev entive
progr ams for both depression and anxiet y (Reivich et al. , 2005). T argeted
prevention approaches are categoriz ed as either selectiv e (i.e. , directed tow ard
individuals at -risk for the disorder based on established risk factors; Greenberg et
al., 2001) or indicated (i.e. , directed tow ard individuals demonstr ating subclinical
symptoms; Greenberg et al. , 2001). While selectiv e or indicated approaches
typically add time and cost to the recruitment process, as participants must qualif y
through screening, it ensures that those receiving the interv ention are most at -riskg g, g
(Calear & Christensen, 2010).
In addition to using more targeted approaches, tr ansdiagnostic prev entive
interv entions that address clinical lev els of both anxiet y and depression ma y be
most beneficial (Garber & W eersing, 2010) giv en their high lev els of comorbidit y in
adolescents (Cummings et al. , 2014). Further , depression and anxiet y share man y
common vulner ability and maintenance factors (e.g. , neuroticism, poor distress
tolerance, poor emotional regulation skills, and high negativ e affect (Cummings et
al., 2014). Thus, a prev entive interv ention approach that targets underlying risk
factors r ather than only disorder -specific symptoms ma y allow for more efficient
prevention.
Specifically , transdiagnostic approaches in the form of cognitiv e-beha vioral ther apy
(CBT) are designed to address common and complex comorbid symptoms (e.g. ,
Barlow & F archione, 2017; Ehrenreich-Ma y & Chu 2014; Ehrenreich-Ma y et al.
2012; Sherman et al. , 2018). These progr ams target common factors to sev eral
disorders and ma y lead to greater benefits such as impro ving dissemination b y
being more cost -effectiv e as well as addressing challenges a greater number of
youth are experiencing and thus could prev ent a broader r ange of
disorders/symptoms. This ma y be particularly important for prev ention progr am
delivery in the school setting, where time and resources for mental health
prevention are limited (Garcia-Escaler a et al. , 2018, 2020; Doz ois et al. , 2009).
Implementing prev ention progr ams within a school setting allows for a natur al and
convenient deliv ery of services, helps foster a strong peer and social support
system, and reduces the potential stigma associated with the acquisition of mental
health services at home or elsewhere (Calear & Christensen, 2009; P aternite,
2005). Further , schools are a k ey resource for identif ying those suffering from
mental health problems, as well as a place for prev enting disorders and fostering
students’ personal dev elopment and well-being (Z enner et al. , 2014). Within the
school en vironment, teachers, counselors, and other staff are in a unique position to
potentially act as gatek eepers and recogniz e vulner able students and pro vide
support and referr als to appropriate services (Sisask et al. , 2014). Further ,
interv ention in schools ma y help to reduce the disparit y in mental health services
among Black and Latino y outh compared to their white counterparts (Cummings &
Druss, 2011; Merikangas et al. , 2010) b y alleviating man y typical barriers
associated with accessing treatment (e.g. , time, location, and cost; Barrett & P ahl,
2006). Giv en the complexit y of the mental health and social needs of minorit y youth
in urban settings, targeted school-based interv entions are a promising a venue in
preventing mental disorders in higher -risk adolescents.
The Unified Protocols for T ransdiagnostic T reatment of Emotional Disorders in
Adolescents (UP- A; Ehrenreich-Ma y et al, 2018) is one such progr am that ma y be
well-suited for deliv ery in urban, div erse school settings. The UP- A addresses a
broad r ange of emotional symptoms in y outh ages 13-17 y ears old and tak es a
transdiagnostic approach b y focusing on a set of core skills and evidence-based
techniques (e.g. , prev enting emotional a voidance, enhancing cognitiv e flexibilit y,
and changing maladaptiv e beha viors) and applying these skills across a r ange of
emotional disorder presentations, including anxiet y and depression symptoms
(Ehrenreich-Ma y et al. , 2017, 2018). Furthermore, the UP- A has been examined as
a univ ersal prev entive interv ention outside of clinical settings. Specifically , in an
open trial conducted in a summer camp setting (K ennedy et al. , 2019), results
indicated that there were significant decreases in anxiet y from pre- to post -
prevention but no changes in depression symptoms. These results are also
consistent with a study that adapted the UP- A as a univ ersal school-based
prevention progr am (García-Escaler a et al. , 2017) and showed that participation in
the progr am w as associated with modest reductions in anxiet y but no significantresults were observ ed for depression symptoms. An important limitation across
these prior studies is the UP- A was only implemented and examined as a univ ersal
approach outside of clinic settings, and research has y et to examine the UP- A as a
targeted prev entive interv ention. Further , these studies limited their assessment to
changes in anxiet y and depression symptoms r ather than expanding to include
changes in more pro ximal predictors (i.e. , target mechanisms). Moreo ver, few
prevention studies include measures of potential mediators of the relation between
the interv ention and the outcome (Horowitz & Garber , 2006). Giv en that the causes
of internalizing disorders lik ely are multifaceted, prev ention progr ams examining
changes in underlying constructs such as emotion regulation, a wareness of emotion
states, and help-seeking beha viors are important components of determining the
success of the UP- A. Thus, a more comprehensiv e measurement of potential
mechanisms of change is needed to giv e a more complete picture of the effects of a
prevention interv ention ev en if the interv ention does not successfully prev ent
internalizing disorders (Horowitz & Garber , 2006). F or example, studies that
included multiple outcome v ariables found that their progr ams mitigated risk factors
associated with depression, ev en if they showed little or no effect on depression
symptoms (Ialongo et al. , 1999; W olchik et al. , 1993).
Taken together , the current liter ature suggests that targeted, school-based
preventive interv entions are a feasible and effectiv e avenue for deliv ering mental
health services among y outh at risk for internalizing disorders. Such interv entions
have the potential to significantly impro ve mental health outcomes for those who
may otherwise not ha ve opportunities for services. In addition to the clear need to
better understand the efficacy of the UP- A in reducing internalizing symptoms and
engagement of tr ansdiagnostic target mechanisms, it is necessary to examine how
urban schools could implement prev entive interv ention services (e.g. , an adapted
version of the UP- A) sustainably . Understanding the attitudes of the school staff
(i.e., teachers, counselors, nurses, social work ers, and administr ators) and their
potential for pro viding informal and formal support to students in need is crucial to
implementing sustainable progr amming (Spence et al. , 2003, 2005).
 Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups,
observations, etc.)
Participants
This study will recruit appro ximately 40 student participants for the open trial, as
well as attempt to enroll the students’ caregiv ers as collater al reporters. Finally , we
plan to enroll appro ximately 10-15 school staff participants for the pre- and post -
interv ention focus groups.  P articipants will be recruited from a Chicago Public High
School (CPS). The total enrollment of students from minorit y identities at the high
school is 94%, and 91.1% of students are considered economically disadv antaged.
Student participants will be recruited through sev eral avenues. Identified staff (e.g. ,
grade-lev el mental health counselors) at the participating school will send
recruitment emails to students regarding the study . School staff ma y send out email
communication with information about the study and the research team will also
advertise the research study via fly ers. R ecruitment materials for treatment
recipients will be geared tow ard individuals in the 9th and 10th gr ades who are
interested in learning skills to manage stress and negativ e emotions, though older
students are eligible. Caregiv ers/parents in this study will be identified b y the
student who expressed interest in the study and will be contacted b y the study
team. P arents/caregiv ers and students will complete a brief telephone screen to
assess the inclusion/ex clusion criteria to determine eligibilit y. Regarding school staff
focus group recruitment, school counselors, administr ators, teachers, and other
staff will be in vited to participate in two 1-hour focus groups (pre- and post -
interv ention). Staff interested in participating will contact the research staff and
consent will be obtained b y a member of the team.
Procedures
Study design information for the students is presented in Figure 1.Study data will be
collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted b y UIC
(Harris et al. , 2009; Harris et al. , 2019).
Telephone Eligibility Screener
A member of the Y oung Adult and Adolescents ADHD Services (Y AAAS) labor atory
will complete a brief telephone screener with interested individuals and their
parents/caregiv ers.  Phone screens will be conducted in either Spanish or English,
depending on the parent/caregiv er’s language preference. Spanish screens will be
conducted b y bi-lingual research assistants who are thoroughly tr ained on the
screening procedures. P arents/caregiv ers will v erbally consent to the brief phone
screen and will pro vide v erbal consent that a member of the research team can
contact their teen to conduct a similar , brief phone screen. Next, with the
parent/caregiv er’s permission, the student will go through the v erbal assent process
for a brief phone screen for eligibilit y for the study . If a student is eligible, the
student and their parent/caregiv er will be in vited for a brief baseline assessment,
which will occur either at the high school, o ver the phone, or via secure video (e.g. ,
Zoom), per participant preference.
 
Baseline Assessment
At the baseline assessment, the study team will collect consent and assentregarding the students' and parents' participation in the prev ention study .
Additionally , the research team will obtain consent to collect student academic
records while the student is in the study and throughout the academic y ear to best
ensure students' academic performances are captured o ver the course of the
progr am. R ecords will be obtained directly from the student or parent/caregiv er as
either a cop y of a report card or self -reported gr ades/GP A. This follow -up review of
academic records will allow the assessment of academic outcomes of students in the
progr am. F or the baseline assessment, we will utiliz e self -report questionnaires and
parents/caregiv ers’ questionnaires via a REDCap link. P arents/caregiv ers and
students will complete three questionnaire visits: baseline, post -interv ention, and 1-
month follow -up. The assessments conducted at these three time points will allow
for analysis of pre-to-post as well as follow -up outcomes associated with the use of
the UP- A adapted as a school-based anxiet y and depression interv ention. F or the
three assessment time points, both parent/caregiv er and student participants will
complete the same questionnaires, with the ex ception of a demogr aphic
questionnaire (baseline only), and each time point assessment will tak e
appro ximately 20–45 minutes total. During these three assessments, students in
the treatment recipient group will answer questions about their social, emotional,
academic, and mental health experiences and their parents/caregiv ers will pro vide
collater al reports on the same domains. P eer supporters will complete
questionnaires focusing on wellbeing and social connectedness. T o encour age
assessment completion at each time point, student participants will be compensated
$20 and parents/caregiv ers will be compensated $15 after completing each
assessment. 
 
Intervention: “Healthy Minds, Happy Lives”
The “Health y Minds, Happ y Lives” open trial interv ention is an adapted v ersion of
the UP- A designed to be deliv ered as a weekly 8–session 40–50-minute school-
based targeted prev entive interv ention for adolescents at risk for depression and
anxiet y. Each group session will target one of the UP- A core modules. An adv anced
doctor al student in clinical psy chology will be implementing the progr am with
supervision from a licensed clinical psy chologist (Dr . Meinz er). Sessions will occur
on-site during the school da y (alternating class periods from week to week).
The interv ention components for each group are listed in T able 1 and described
below . In the first session, the intended activ e component is building motiv ation.
The students pro vide their three top problems and a SMAR T (that is, Specific,
Measur able, A ttainable, R elevant, and Time-bound) goal for each problem. The
active component of the second session is psy choeducation about emotions. Here,
the students learn about the function of emotions and what emotional beha viors
are. In the third session, the intended activ e component is beha vioral activ ation.
During this session, students learn about the cy cle of a voidance as well as the
meaning of opposite action and beha vioral experiments. Additionally , students will
reflect on their current use of free time and compile a list of enjo yable activities with
which to engage in opposite actions when experiencing sadness or stress. F or the
fourth session, the intended activ e component is psy choeducation about body
sensations, in which students learn about ph ysical sensations associated with
emotions and pr actice body scanning relaxation ex ercises. The fifth session’ s activ e
component is cognitiv e restructuring. The concept of “thinking tr aps” (that is,
cognitiv e distortions) and detectiv e thinking skills (that is, cognitiv e reappr aisal) will
be introduced that week. In the sixth session the activ e components are cognitiv e
restructuring and problem-solving skills. Here, students review the concept of
thinking tr aps and detectiv e thinking skills and learn how to o vercome problems
using problem-solving skills. F or the sev enth session, the intended activ ecomponents are present -moment a wareness, the cy cle of a voidance, and exposure.
During this session, the students review the a voidance cy cle, learn about present -
moment and non-judgmental a wareness, learn about emotional exposures, and
practice focused breathing. Finally , the intended activ e component for the eighth
session is relapse prev ention. Students in this final session will re-r ate their top
problems, review the str ategies learned in the progr am, and create an individualiz ed
post-progr am plan to pr actice skills.
Some notable modifications from both the UP- A manual and the adolescent UP- A
workbook handouts should be noted. The UP- A materials for sessions 7 and 8 are
combined into one session, such that content and skills for present moment
awareness, the cy cle of a voidance, and emotional exposures are co vered together .
This change is made to accommodate the time constr aints of the school’ s academic
calendar . Further , while students will receiv e the majorit y of the UP- A workbook
handouts each week, they will also be pro vided additional handouts to clarif y the
information co vered in sessions (i.e. , more visual aids and skill-pr actice
worksheets). The supplemental materials are intended to highlight important
content co vered in the UP- A while also pro viding additional opportunities for skill
practice during group session time. Supplemental materials include: A fillable CB T
triangle worksheet, weekly activit y log worksheets, reflection questions about
homework, a fight -or-flight handout, an emotion surfing handout, a cognitiv e
restructuring worksheet, a “thoughts on trial” worksheet, and a de-catastrophizing
worksheet. Ev en though the content of these supplemental materials is co vered in
the UP- A, its workbook is limited in the number of “hands-on” activities. Thus, to
maximiz e group engagement, participation, and self -reflection, additional materials
are included.
Another important modification is the remo val of the weekly re-r ating of “T op
Problems. ” The UP- A manual instructs students to pro vide a new r ating each week
to their “T op Problems” created during Session 1. Giv en the time constr aints of
holding sessions within the appro ximately 45-minute class period, this activit y was
removed and replaced b y reflection questions about homework. Further , we decided
to prioritiz e adequately introducing and discussing new content/skills each week vs.
focusing on initial “T op Problems. ”

Weekly Intervention Summary Parent Video
 
A weekly video summary of the material and skills co vered in the group w as created
using V yond™, an online animated softw are progr am. Videos r ange between 2-
4 minutes in length with animation and v oiceovers of a structured script
communicating information to parents/caregiv ers about skills co vered in the group
and suggestions for w ays to help their child implement the skills for the upcoming
week. Information in the script w as dev eloped using the UP- A clinician manual. T o
ensure the videos were accessible for all parents/caregiv ers, Spanish v ersions of the
videos were tr anslated b y multiple bi-lingual research assistants.
Post-Intervention Assessment
After the 8- week progr am concludes, in addition to completing measures,
parents/caregiv ers and students will be ask ed to participate in a brief interview
(appro ximately 30 minutes) about their experiences in the progr am, suggestions for
impro vement, and gener al thoughts about stress and sadness as a high school
student, which will occur either at the student ’s high school, o ver the phone, or
secure video (e.g. , Zoom), per participant preference. P eer supporters will be ask ed
specific questions about their experiences in the peer support role and suggestions
for the future. This qualitativ e feedback will be ev aluated to inform future
modifications of the prev ention progr am.
Staff Focus Groups
Interested CPS staff will be consented to participate in pre– and post –open trial
focus groups. F ocus groups with school staff will be recorded and will tak e place
either virtually (i.e. , Zoom) or in a priv ate space at the high school. The groups are
designed to elicit school staff feedback and input through a group discussion about
issues students face in their classrooms/school, specifically regarding social and
emotional function, and the impacts these challenges ha ve on students' academics.The feedback will be analyz ed to help modif y and refine the progr am as well as its
implications for future sustainabilit y.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
The proposed study’ s aims will be met through a combination of quantitativ e and
qualitativ e analyses. Aim 2 will be achiev ed through ev aluating student outcomes
via Reliable Change Indices (RCIs; Jacobson et al. , 1984) a quantitativ e approach
for examining clinically significant change. Aim 3 will be achiev ed through gold-
standard focus group methodology and subsequent qualitativ e analyses.
RCIs will be used to ev aluate clinically meaningful change from pre-interv ention
(i.e., baseline) to subsequent assessments (post and 1-month follow -up) for
parents/caregiv ers and student participants. RCI analyses will be used to examine
individual-lev el changes in measures of depression symptoms, anxiet y symptoms,
emotion regulation, emotional state a wareness, and beha vioral activ ation from pre-
to post -interv ention. The statistical information required for RCI analyses will be
used for all measures. An RCI that is greater than or equal to 1.96 or less than or
equal to –1.96 signals reliable change at p< .05.
In addition to quantitativ e data, qualitativ e feedback from pre- and post -interv ention
school staff focus groups will be analyz ed as well as parent/caregiv er and student
post-interv ention interviews. The focus group information for school staff will be
obtained pre- and post -interv ention to further fine-tune the “Health y Minds, Happ y
Lives” progr am for the continued use in low -income, urban high schools.
Transcripts of the staff focus groups and post -interv ention parent/caregiv er and
student interviews will be created, edited, and v erified b y three research team
members. The PI will dev elop a codebook that will be refined iter atively through an
open coding process across parent/caregiv er and student interviews and school staff
focus groups. This comprehensiv e process will ensure that the codebook is
appropriate for the entire dataset. Discrepancies during the coding process will be
resolv ed through consensus. Once a codebook is finaliz ed, two analysts will code
the full data set using NViv o 12 Pro (QSR International Pt y Ltd, 2020). The PI will
develop the codebook and analyz e the coded data for themes, an inductiv e
approach that allows for patterns in the text to be determined from the words of the
participants themselv es and with no a priori h ypotheses. As themes “emerge” from
the data, the PI will select quotations from the text that capture the defined themes
richly and do not require contextual knowledge from the focus groups to
comprehend (Br aun & Clark e, 2006; Miles et al. , 2014)."

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago serv es as a large pro vider of out -of-
school (OST) progr ams across the Chicagoland area. The Y’ s OST progr ams
collabor ate with man y schools in the cit y and suburbs to pro vide afterschool
services through both a tr aditional and communit y schools initiativ e (CSI)
model, with an emphasis on high-qualit y progr am offerings guided b y youth
development best pr actices for learning.
There is immense v alue in afterschool progr ams, especially in the CPS/ CSI
setting. R esearch from the Afterschool Alliance shows that 9 in 10 adults sa y
that afterschool progr ams are important to their communities. Students who
participate in qualit y afterschool progr ams are more lik ely to dev elop strong
social skills, impro ve work habits and gr ades, impro ve their school
attendance, and ha ve higher gr aduation r ates.
Afterschool progr ams also show a v aluable return on in vestment - for ev ery
$1 invested in afterschool progr ams, $3 are sa ved by increasing y outh’s
earning potential, impro ving their performance at school, and aiding in
reduction of crime and juv enile delinquency . Initial research on the short
term effects of the communit y school model, specifically , has been
encour aging. In a liter ature review of the existing research on communit y
schools, Heers et al. (2016) found communit y schools to be associated with
“increased academic performance, a lower dropout r ate, and reduced risky
behavior” (p.10). The attributes of communit y schools found to be most
directly associated with these outcomes were integr ated resources, parental
involvement, and participation in extr acurricular activities. They concluded
that because communit y schools pro vide services and resources that ma y be
otherwise una vailable to students, they are better able to focus on school
and are more motiv ated and engaged in the classroom. 
In partnership with Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and the 21st Century
Communit y Learning Centers (21st Century), the Y’ s Communit y Schools
Initiativ e leverages partners and resources to offer a wide r ange of
progr amming and supports to school- age y outh and their families. By
providing robust, high-qualit y
out-of-school time (OST) enrichment activities, Y -CSI sites serv e as
centralized communit y hubs that promote academic, social-emotional, and
physical well-being. Y outh dev elop the skills and competencies they need to
succeed both in and outside of the classroom, and parents are better
equipped to support their child’ s learning and to meet their own goals. Since
2004, Y -CSI progr ams ha ve serv ed thousands of K -8 students across
low-income and underserv ed Chicago neighborhoods with life-changing
progr amming that empowers them to learn, grow , and thriv e. In addition to
Y-CSI, the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago runs OST progr amming, both in
afterschool and camp settings, at sev eral other CPS sites throughout the
city. These sites are partnered directly with the YMCA of Metro Chicago and
do not function under a CSI model.All Y OST progr ams aim to impro ve academic and social-emotional well-
being b y providing a div erse offering of progr amming and services that
extend student learning bey ond the classroom and engage parents and
families in their child’ s success.
As part of a broader ev aluation portfolio at the YMCA of Metro Chicago ,
assessment and progr am ev aluation is embedded in all OST progr amming
and serv es as a complement to existing continuous impro vement efforts
supported b y CPS’ CSI. This protocol outlines assessment and
evaluation done within OST sites, specifically those that are CPS,
with a heavy emphasis on CSI sites . All ev aluation efforts led b y the

None noted - this is ev aluation / continuous impro vement focused in nature.","to Date
During F all 2023, parent/caregiv ers, YMCA staff , and Y -CPS y outh were
assessed via surv ey. All primary data collection efforts ha ve been in
compliance with the most up-to-date primary data collection guidance and
research policies issued from the Department of School Qualit y
Measurement and R esearch at CPS . In addition to primary data collection,
data from secondary sources (Thriv e Chicago’ s Data Dashboard, Chicago
Health A tlas, and other secondary data sources) has been used to
supplement data efforts. Data such as child demogr aphics, attendance, and
other metrics are also used to measure progr am outputs. Y outh Progr am
Qualit y Assessment (PQA), an instrument designed b y the W eikart Center
for Youth Progr am Qualit y aimed to measure the qualit y of y outh
progr amming and aid in identif ying staff tr aining needs, has been used to
measure global progr am qualit y. PQA leads the Y’ s robust system for
continuous impro vement and is a mainsta y during a tr aditional OST
academic y ear. Spring data collection is on hold, pending appro val of
modifications b y CPS RRB .Preliminary Results to Date
As a result of our ev aluation activities, we ha ve been able to support the
continuous impro vement cy cle for our CPS OST progr ams. T o date, we ha ve
completed our 2022-2023 school y ear data analysis. In our Spring 2023
survey, youth reported abo ve-target scores in sev eral domains across 100%
of our CSI sites, including safe en vironment (3.8) and relationships with
staff (3.6). Also during our Spring 2023 surv ey, our CPS parents/caregiv ers
provided a Net Promoter Score (lik elihood of recommending our progr am to
family/friends) of 86. A Net Promoter Score abo ve 75 is considered world
class. 95% of parents/guardians indicated that their child has become more
interested in meeting new people, and 92% reported that their child is more
interested in trying new things, because of participating in CSI
progr amming. Our 2023-2024 school y ear analysis will be completed after
we ha ve fielded our Spring 2024 surv eys of y outh, staff , and caregiv ers.

Focus grouping ma y take place at Y -CSI Progr am Sites ONL Y. For the
upcoming academic y ear, we ha ve zero focus groups planned, howev er
would lik e the option should one be deemed relev ant and necessary . Focus
groups of CPS staff ma y occur under the CSI model to further tease out
fidelit y to the CSI progr am model. If a focus group occurs, it will tak e place
on-site at the progr am location, will be no more than 1 hour in length, and
will be with staff . Focus groups of CPS staff will enable the Y to better
understand (1) integr ation of the Y’ s afterschool progr amming into the
overall school, (2) fidelit y to the communit y schools model, and (3) gauge
perceptions, attitudes, and other feedback on CSI progr ams within the CPS
school. F ocus groups of CPS-emplo yed staff will tak e place on CPS grounds,
while Y staff not emplo yed by CPS will occur at Y progr am locations. With

Data Management & Statistical Analysis
Data is collected via Alchemer (formerly Surv eyGizmo). Alchemer upholds
strict data securit y usage procedures and policies which are outlined in detail
at
https://help .alchemer .com/help/alchemer -securit y-overview .
Primary surv ey data is either maintained and stored in Alchemer or
downloaded for data processing. An y downloaded data that is to be k ept with
PII is stored on secure serv ers in the YMCA data center . PII data is
immediately assigned to a crossw alk to allow for confidential and safe
processing and analyses of data. In some y outh surv eys, each y outh is
assigned a unique ID to allow for optimal confidentialit y when they are
completing their surv ey (see Data Collection T ool - Afterschool Y outh Surv ey
as an example). No PHI is collected.
PII is only collected when longitudinal analysis occurs - either from pre to
post surv ey point within an academic school y ear, or from y ear to y ear. PII is
also collected to further disaggregate respondents to identif y trends in other
demogr aphics such as age, gender , and/or r ace/ethnicit y. PII might also be
self-reported b y an adult surv ey respondent in the form of their name, email
address, and/or phone number . This opt -in field is only is a parent/caregiv er
would lik e to be contacted b y a YMCA staff member to discuss their progr am
experience and is solely used as a mark et research tool.
All data is analyz ed via Microsoft Ex cel or using SPS S. Additionally , some
data is processed and analyz ed in Alchemer ’s reporting function. Some
aggregate, non-identifiable data might also be added to Google Data Studio
for larger , overarching reporting. Due to the nature of the Y’ s needs and use,more adv anced statistical techniques are not utiliz ed. Per the code of feder al
regulations, all data will be retained for 3 y ears from the end of the project
period.
Protection Against Risk.
All data will be de-identified. W e will strictly follow data safet y and
monitoring plans discussed in 7.1 to protect confidentialit y of PII. W e will
protect identifiable data on a secure serv er and analyz e them when only
accessing the serv er. Per the code of feder al regulations, all data will be
retained for 3 y ears from the end of the project period. In addition, all surv ey
questions are hea vily v etted. Questions are pulled from v alidated tools that
have been dev eloped and used b y trained research staff in a y outh
development setting. All final surv eys for Y ev aluations are first pilot tested
by internal adult v olunteers who work closely with y outh. An y questions that
might be inappropriate, elicit emotional states, or that might be confusing to
a youth are discussed and either modified or remo ved from the assessment.

Youth. Y outh participants in Y -CPS OST ev aluation efforts will be enrolled
through activ e consent and assent procedures outlined in section 6.10 and in
direct compliance with CPS research guidance and restrictions on consent
and assent. Y outh participants will be in volved in ev aluation efforts if they
(1) ha ve parental consent to partak e in ev aluation activities and
assessment; (2) are between the ages of 6-18; (3) meet appropriate assent
processes giv en youth age; (4) are meeting all other restrictions for consent
and assent per CPS policies.
Youth are considered lost to follow -up from ev aluation activities if they lea ve
the progr am during the school y ear, or if data is not able to be collected
from them for unknown reasons during the progr am window (Note: these
are only for y outh that can be identified via data). These y outh are
subsequently remo ved from the data analyses process. Due to the Y efforts
being for ev aluation purposes, this does not affect the integrit y of findings.
Adults - Staff & P arents/ Caregiv ers. CPS staff participants in Y -CSI
evaluation efforts will be enrolled through activ e consent procedures outlined
in section 6.10. CPS staff participants will be in volved in ev aluation efforts if
they (1) ha ve consented to participate in ev aluation activities, (2) ha ve
appro val from their school administr ator to participate in ev aluation
activities, (3) are meeting all other restrictions for consent and participation
per CPS policies.
6.2. Sample Siz e. There is no target sample siz e for OST ev aluation and
assessment efforts. Ev aluation efforts under the Y -CPS OST progr ams do not
need to be powered for an y analyses. Howev er, the Y estimates
appro ximately 1,600 eligible participants - 750 individuals age 6-17, 100
individuals who are staff aged 18 and older , and 750 parent/ caregiv ers aged
18 and older .
6.3. R ecruitment & Screening Methods. Enrollment of y outh into progr am
evaluation and assessment is contingent upon enrollment of y outh into Y -
CPS OST progr ams. Y outh are enrolled in Y OST progr ams upon registr ation
as part of normal Y oper ations and procedures. If part of a CSI progr am,
youth are input into Cit yspan, a CPS-required platform for managing gr ant
agreements and monitoring gr antee performance. Y outh are not activ ely
recruited for ev aluation efforts. All y outh that meet inclusion criteria are
eligible to partak e in progr am ev aluation and assessment. Screening
happens using Cit yspan or CCC to determine who to identif y, based on age
inclusion criteria, for the assent process. Inclusion lists are cross referenced
against consent/assent paperwork to determine y outh will ultimately
participate in assessment.
6.6. Data Collection Modalities and Detail - Before/ After OST School- YearProgr ams (see Section 17.0 for data collection tools)
6.6.a. F all and Spring Y outh Surv eys. This surv ey is administered to all
consented/assented y outh via paper b y Y staff or electronically via a
password protected surv ey softw are. If the surv ey is administered via paper
(due to limited technology , youth needs for answering, and/ or unreliable
bandwidth) cross-link ed IDs are added to y outh surv eys to protect identit y
and ensure data confidentialit y. Paper surv ey data with no personally
identifiable information is then stored in Alchemer and is input b y the YMCA ’s
Research & Ev aluation team (formerly Learning & Ev aluation (L&E)). Surv ey
and data collection procedures will be the same for individuals enrolled in
the Y’ s STEAM Club and the Breaking Barriers progr am (outlined more in
detail below).
Y-C PS y outh are surv eyed in the F all and Spring of each academic school
year. The surv ey consists mainly of v alidated scales from the Surv ey of
Academic and Y outh Outcomes- Y outh Surv ey (S AYO-Y), along with other
questions built to specifically ask about Y -specific elements, such as safet y.
In addition, sev eral questions are borrowed from the Y outh Engagement,
Motiv ation and Beliefs Surv ey dev eloped b y the Y outh Dev elopment
Executiv es of King Count y. Questions regarding y outh outcomes from the
American Camp Association Y outh Outcomes Battery (ACA -YOB) are used in
family surv eys. All instruments ha ve been v alidated in OST y outh progr ams.
Questions created bespok e are cognitiv ely tested with Y stak eholders prior
to administr ation.
Additional detail on S AYO-Y. The S AYO-Y is a research-based, v alidated, and
user-friendly instrument dev eloped b y the National Institute for Out -of-
School time (NIOST). R esearch suggests that certain y outh experiences and
outcomes are critical to future success, and S AYO-Y can show where y our
progr am is succeeding or in need of extr a attention within these areas.
SAYO-Y is used to surv ey youth participants and collect data about what
they are getting out of y our progr am. The tool is adaptable and can be
tailored to gather data in all or part of the following areas: (1) Progr am
Experiences (engagement, choice, challenge, social en vironment, etc.); (2)
Future Expectations (future planning, aspir ations, college planning, etc.);
and (3) Sense of Competence (reading, writing, math, science, getting along
with others, etc.)
Measures:
● Progr am Experiences (S AYO-Y)
○ Supportiv e social en vironment
○ Satisfaction and engagement
○ Supportiv e adults
○ Youth v oice
● Sense of Competence (S AYO-Y)

burden across progr am sites. F or campers age 12 and older , the ACA -YOB
basic v ersion is used, also as a cross-sectional data capture at the end of
camp for sev eral domains of interest (camp connectedness, team work).
The ACA -YOB is administered via a short protocol dev eloped b y the ACA
which requires progr am staff to administer the surv ey directly to y outh.
Surveys include the camper age, but no other sources of PII. Data is
collected either via paper or electronically (via tablet or computer). An y data
not collected electronically is immediately collected and input into Alchemer .
Paper copies of surv eys are sa ved and stored in a lock ed cabinet for 6
months before being destro yed. Data is benchmark ed across publicly -
available national data to measure where the YMCA camp progr am measures
in comparison to other camp progr am sites.
The ACA -YOB measures y outh perceptions within the following skill-based
and camp-specific areas:
● Family R elationships● Friendship skills*
● Independence*
● Affinit y for Explor ation*
● Perceiv ed Competence*
● Responsibilit y*
● Teamwork**
● Affinit y for Nature*
● Problem- Solving Confidence*
● Camp Connectedness**
* Measured in select y outh sites (none of which were CPS sites) in 2019,
campers age 6-9. Assessment did not occur in 2020 or 2021.
** Measured in select y outh sites (none of which were CPS sites) 2019, all
campers. Assessment did not occur in 2020 or 2021.
6.7.b. Mid and End-of -Camp P arent/Caregiv er Short Assess (mid-point) and
Survey (post -progr am). T wo surv eys are administered to parents/caregiv ers:
one mid-summer and another at the end of progr amming. This surv ey is
administered to all consented parents/caregiv ers that meet inclusion criteria
electronically via a link sent to their email or phone OR administered on-site
via tablet (to families with low bandwidth, limited technology access). PII is
not collected in this surv ey unless the parent includes identif ying information
in an open ended surv ey response. Surv ey questions are cr afted to minimiz e
the risk that parents will share personally identifiable information. Surv ey
data is then stored in Alchemer , is password protected, and is input b y the
YMCA ’s Research & Ev aluation team.
The surv ey(s) consists mainly of v alidated scales from the American Camp
Association Y outh Outcomes Battery: P arent P erspectiv es (ACA -YOB: PP),
which is a v alidated tool to measure parental perceptions of growth within
their child(ren) affected b y involvement in before/after school progr amming.
Other questions were built specifically to measure Y -specific elements, such
as satisfaction, perceptions of safet y and trust within the progr am.
Questions created bespok e are cognitiv ely tested with Y staff prior to
administr ation.
Measures:
● Satisfaction (Net Promoter Score(NPS))
● Parent perceptions of progr am purpose (y outh dev elopment vs. child care;
internally dev eloped)
● Relationships and communication with progr am staff (internally dev eloped)
● Interest/Engagement with family/adult progr amming (internally
developed)
● Interest/Engagement with progr am planning and decision-making
(internally dev eloped)
● ACA -YOB: PP scales include all those listed under the ACA -YOB Youth
Survey outcomes, howev er ask parent/ caregiv ers to reflect on their
perception of the impact on their child(ren) in those areas.
6.7.c. Mid and End-of -Camp Staff Surv eys. This surv ey collects information
regarding staff perceptions, expectations, experiences, and o verall feedback
surrounding camp progr amming. This is conducted in conjunction with theYMCA ’s Human R esources Department. As part of formal onboarding to
being an emplo yee of the YMCA of Metro Chicago , staff consent to occasional
data collection. The surv ey is administered electronically via email mid-
progr am and at the end of the progr am cy cle. The end-of -camp surv ey also
aids in future planning for the upcoming school y ear. All questions are
bespok e and internally created b y the Y’ s R&E team.
Measures:
● Sense of safet y and support within progr am
● Sense of safet y and support from supervisor/team
● Satisfaction/ perception of preparedness from camp staff tr ainings
● Open feedback for impro vement and strengths
● Attitudes tow ards specific progr am components

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago serv es as a large pro vider of out -of-
school (OST) progr ams across the Chicagoland area. The Y’ s OST progr ams
collabor ate with man y schools in the cit y and suburbs to pro vide afterschool
services through both a tr aditional and communit y schools initiativ e (CSI)
model, with an emphasis on high-qualit y progr am offerings guided b y youth
development best pr actices for learning.
There is immense v alue in afterschool progr ams, especially in the CPS/ CSI
setting. R esearch from the Afterschool Alliance shows that 9 in 10 adults sa y
that afterschool progr ams are important to their communities. Students who
participate in qualit y afterschool progr ams are more lik ely to dev elop strong
social skills, impro ve work habits and gr ades, impro ve their school
attendance, and ha ve higher gr aduation r ates.
Afterschool progr ams also show a v aluable return on in vestment - for ev ery
$1 invested in afterschool progr ams, $3 are sa ved by increasing y outh’s
earning potential, impro ving their performance at school, and aiding in
reduction of crime and juv enile delinquency . Initial research on the short
term effects of the communit y school model, specifically , has been
encour aging. In a liter ature review of the existing research on communit y
schools, Heers et al. (2016) found communit y schools to be associated with
“increased academic performance, a lower dropout r ate, and reduced risky
behavior” (p.10). The attributes of communit y schools found to be most
directly associated with these outcomes were integr ated resources, parental
involvement, and participation in extr acurricular activities. They concluded
that because communit y schools pro vide services and resources that ma y be
otherwise una vailable to students, they are better able to focus on school
and are more motiv ated and engaged in the classroom. 
In partnership with Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and the 21st Century
Communit y Learning Centers (21st Century), the Y’ s Communit y Schools
Initiativ e leverages partners and resources to offer a wide r ange of
progr amming and supports to school- age y outh and their families. By
providing robust, high-qualit y
out-of-school time (OST) enrichment activities, Y -CSI sites serv e as
centralized communit y hubs that promote academic, social-emotional, and
physical well-being. Y outh dev elop the skills and competencies they need to
succeed both in and outside of the classroom, and parents are better
equipped to support their child’ s learning and to meet their own goals. Since
2004, Y -CSI progr ams ha ve serv ed thousands of K -8 students across
low-income and underserv ed Chicago neighborhoods with life-changing
progr amming that empowers them to learn, grow , and thriv e. In addition to
Y-CSI, the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago runs OST progr amming, both in
afterschool and camp settings, at sev eral other CPS sites throughout the
city. These sites are partnered directly with the YMCA of Metro Chicago and
do not function under a CSI model.All Y OST progr ams aim to impro ve academic and social-emotional well-
being b y providing a div erse offering of progr amming and services that
extend student learning bey ond the classroom and engage parents and
families in their child’ s success.
As part of a broader ev aluation portfolio at the YMCA of Metro Chicago ,
assessment and progr am ev aluation is embedded in all OST progr amming
and serv es as a complement to existing continuous impro vement efforts
supported b y CPS’ CSI. This protocol outlines assessment and
evaluation done within OST sites, specifically those that are CPS,
with a heavy emphasis on CSI sites . All ev aluation efforts led b y the
YMCA of Metro Chicago at CPS sites are solely for continuous impro vement
of progr ams and assur ance of

PROPOSAL. 
Overview of YMCA Evaluation and Measurement Processes. All
evaluation and assessment efforts are guided b y equitable ev aluation
approaches. Utilizing equitable ev aluation fr ameworks allows for
collabor ative inquiry between YMCA ev aluators, other Y staff , and, at times,
CPS staff . This approach also ensures that goals and objectiv es of progr ams
are created and monitored holistically , data is handled safely but that results
are also tr ansparent (in aggregate, non-identifiable form), and that data is
used for continuous impro vement and motiv ating positiv e impact within
YMCA -CPS progr ams.
All progr am areas (i.e. da y camp , before and after school progr amming,
family engagement progr ams and str ategies) undergo an annual
collabor ative process that includes:
●       Meeting with staff and stak eholders to review , develop, and modif y
overall progr am goals and objectiv es. This includes con versation about what
a successful progr am looks lik e and what staff would need to ensure a
threshold lev el of success.
●       Dev elopment (or modification if already created) of a progr am-specific
logic model and accompan ying ev aluation plan. Once created, both
documents are v etted and aligned upon
●       Implementation of the ev aluation process utilizing equitable ev aluation
approaches
●       Safe, tr ansparent, and r apid (if applicable) sharing of data results and
discussion of learnings
Overall assessment of Y -CPS OST progr amming focuses on sev eral key
areas:
●       Y outh outcomes and impact
●       F amily (parent/caregiv er-guided) outcomes and impact
●       Staff (Y only for non-CSI CPS sites, Y and CPS staff for CSI sites)
outcomes and impact
●       Progr am Qualit y, which focuses on progr am en vironment, the qualit y
of inter actions between staff and y outh, engagement of y outh in
progr amming, site-specific y outh-centered policies and pr actices,
expectations of y outh and staff , and access to progr amming.●       Fidelit y to outlined progr am model (CSI sites only)
Additional details on data collection tools and processes are outlined in
section 6.0.
OST School-Year Programs: Evaluation efforts gener ally run on an
academic y ear calendar . Assessment via surv eying gener ally occurs in the
Fall and Spring. A t these time points, parent/caregiv ers, Y staff , and Y y outh
are assessed via surv ey. In addition, and if relev ant for the progr am model,
focus groups and/or stak eholder interviews with Y staff and school staff
might also be conducted to gain additional insight and information. In
addition to primary data collection, data from secondary sources (Thriv e
Chicago’ s Data Dashboard, 5Essentials Surv ey, Chicago Health A tlas, and
others) is used to supplement data efforts. Internal data to the Y , such as
child demogr aphics, attendance, and other metrics is also used to measure
progr am outputs and dosage. Y outh Progr am Qualit y Assessment (PQA), an
instrument designed b y the W eikart Center for Y outh Progr am Qualit y aimed
to measure the qualit y of y outh progr amming and aid in identif ying staff
training needs, is used to measure OST progr am qualit y. The PQA process
leads the Y’ s robust system for continuous impro vement and is a mainsta y
during a tr aditional OST academic y ear.
CSI-sites only: Leveraging CSI’ s Continuous Qualit y Impro vement Plan
(CQIP), internal assessment occurs to measure the Y’ s effectiv eness in
meeting fidelit y to the CSI model. This assessment occurs throughout the
academic y ear, utiliz es data already collected from other outlets, and does
not require an y additional assessment of y outh, families, or staff .
YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago’s STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
Arts, Math) Club (Enrichment programming):  Starting in academic y ear
2022-23, a small number of CPS locations will hold after school STEAM Club
as an enrichment progr am offered b y the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago .
Youth in STEAM Club will learn about v arious computer concepts through
guided tutorials, challenges, and open-ended projects. They will learn how to
plan and design different projects based on the weeks’ concept, inspired b y
their experience and will solv e problems using different softw are application.
The progr am will focus on some centr al concepts of progr amming, including
coding, game dev elopment, computer -aided design, and 3d printing, and
web dev elopment, as well as introducing the new topics of robotics, arduino
(an open-source electronics protot yping platform), and engineering design.  
YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago’s Breaking Barriers, Uniting Cultures
Enrichment Program: Starting in academic y ear 2022-23, a small number of
CPS locations will hold a new after school enrichment progr am called,
Breaking Barriers, Uniting Cultures. The progr am aims to increase cultur al
understanding of groups different from a y outh’s own, strengthen y outh’s
sense of pride and cultur al identit y, and enable the formation of new
relationships with people from different backgrounds.
Day Camp Programs: Evaluation efforts gener ally run from June to
September , howev er are dependent on and aligned to the CPS progr am
calendar . Assessment via surv eying of families and Y staff gener ally occursmid-progr amming and at the end of progr amming. Y outh are assessed at the
end of camp progr amming under a formal protocol from the American Camp
Association. Y outh and their parent/caregiv er are also giv en an option to
provide data/feedback via the parent surv ey. PQA occurs at all progr am sites
throughout the summer . Internal data to the Y , such as child demogr aphics,
attendance, and other metrics is also used to measure progr am outputs.","and Analytical Technique
Since Winter 2023, the Y has not used Google for data
analysis. I updated this to reflect our current use of P ower BI.

Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
THERE IS NO FORMAL RESEARCH METHODS, THIS IS PURE
EVALUATIVE IN NATURE. Section ""Funding & Intervention"" outlines
more about the data collection processes.
Additionally , primary surv ey data is either maintained and stored in
Alchemer or downloaded for data processing. An y downloaded data that is to
be kept with PII is stored on secure serv ers in the YMCA data center . PII
data is immediately assigned to a crossw alk to allow for confidential and safe
processing and analyses of data. In some y outh surv eys, each y outh is
assigned a unique ID to allow for optimal confidentialit y when they are
completing their surv ey. No PHI is collected.
PII is only collected when longitudinal analysis occurs - either from pre to
post surv ey point within an academic school y ear, or from y ear to y ear. PII is
also collected to further disaggregate respondents to identif y trends in other
demogr aphics such as age, gender , and/or r ace/ethnicit y. PII might also be
self-reported b y an adult surv ey respondent in the form of their name, email
address, and/or phone number . This opt -in field is only is a parent/caregiv er
would lik e to be contacted b y a YMCA staff member to discuss their progr am
experience and is solely used as a mark et research tool.
All data is analyz ed via Microsoft Ex cel or using SPS S. Additionally , some
data is processed and analyz ed in Alchemer ’s reporting function. Some
aggregate, non-identifiable data might also be added to P ower BI for larger ,
overarching reporting. Due to the nature of the Y’ s needs and use, more
advanced statistical techniques are not utiliz ed. Per the code of feder al
regulations, all data will be retained for 3 y ears from the end of the project
period."

This project seeks to understand the impact of recent reforms to CPS’ s transfer policy
for students mo ving from neighborhood high schools into Options schools. It consists of
four data analysis activities: 1) understanding the shifting dynamics of tr ansferring
students before and after the reform using secondary student -level data, 2) exploring
the perspectiv es of students, families, and school personnel engaged in the new
transfer process, 3) char acterizing the current and ev olving school-lev el supports for
students considering tr ansfer , and 4) assessing the policy implementation process via
procedur al records and 30 process observ ations. Original data collection will occur
Winter 2022 - Summer 2023; secondary data will span 2008 - 2023 as a vailable
Although CPS has long-standing research-pr actice collabor ations, historically most of
that research has not included Option Schools or the tr ansfer into Option Schools. Due
to the opacit y of Option Schools, it is difficult for the district to ha ve a clear
understanding of how students are tr ansferred to Option Schools, under what
circumstances this tr ansfer occurs, and what services CPS students receiv e once they
enroll in an Option School. Therefore, this project will pro vide CPS with A) essential
information about the patterns of Option School tr ansfer , B) meaningful insight into how
the tr ansfer policy is implemented b y neighborhood schools, C) critical knowledge about
how students and their guardians experience and engage with the tr ansfer process, and
D) immediately actionable insights regarding how the tr ansfer process might be
strengthened and how/where resources might be best applied to reduce tr ansfer out of
neighborhood schools. The Option School tr ansfer policy outcome and process

Hougard and Molly Mik olajczyk. The collabor ation ensures that the ev aluation
foregrounds analyz es that are going to be meaningful to district policy and education
practice.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Ewing, Da vis & Guz (2021) refer to r acially str atified gr aduation r ates and the school
push-out of Black, Indigenous and Students of Color (BIPOC) as two of the largest
conversations in education scholarship , policy , and public discourse. Notably , the
authors refer to the experiences of Option School students as the in visible ‘wedge’
between these two , otherwise well studied phenomena. This mix ed methods research
project, submitted in partnership with staff at Chicago Public Schools (CPS), aims to
address the in visibilit y of these students’ experiences through an outcome and process
evaluation of the updated Option School tr ansfer policy:
1. How does expanded a vailabilit y of Options School placements impact school discipline
practice in neighborhood schools? (Secondary student -level data)
2. How does increased o versight from the district and standardization of pre-tr ansfer
requirements shift (a) the number of students who tr ansfer , (b) the risk profiles of
students tr ansferring into Option Schools, and (c) school attendance and continued
enrollment among those most lik ely to tr ansfer? (Secondary student -level data)
3. How do district and school personnel conceptualiz e the sets of services that can
appropriately be pro vided b y neighborhood schools? What t ypes of student needs do
district and school personnel understand as best met in an alternativ e setting?
(Interviews, Observ ations, Procedur al Records)
4. How do students and their guardian(s) experience and engage with the reformed
transfer policy? (Interviews & Observ ations)","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What
is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the
body of extant knowledge?
Option Schools sit at the nexus of sev eral areas of contempor ary education discourses
on racial str atification, including the systematic push-out of Black students and students
with disabilities (George, 2015), school accountabilit y (Fedders, 2018), and school
choice. In a recent study Ewing, Da vis & Guz (2021) documented that the experiences
of Option School students form a ‘wedge’ between these otherwise well-studied
phenomena. T o demonstr ate, while outright school expulsion is relativ ely rare (0.2% of
students; de Brey et al. , 2019) and suspension pr actices in mainstream schools ha ve
been the focus of extensiv e study (Sulliv an, Van Norman & Klingbeil,2014; Steinberg &
Lacoe, 2018), the 3% of high school students who tr ansfer to an Option School are
largely absent from academic liter ature and policy discourse (Carv er, Lewis & Tice,
2010).
This research project aims to pro vide methodological and topical inno vations to the
existing Option School academic and pr actice liter ature. First, methodologically ,
research on Option Schools has not used district administr ative data to quantitativ ely
evaluate district policy or inform qualitativ e approaches. The majorit y of the secondary
quantitativ e Option School liter ature used national or state lev el data whereas primary
quantitativ e research t ypically sampled a single Option School site (Guz et al. , in
prepar ation). As a result, the quantitativ e liter ature lacks the depth offered b y a
systems perspectiv e and place-based analysis. Further , although the liter ature is mainly
qualitativ e, the majorit y of the qualitativ e research does not engage with critical
theories, has not included the family of Option School students, and has primarily
collected interview data at single time points. This is limiting, as schooling is not an
individual student experience or static experience, it is a gener ational and communal
experience ev olves over time and place.
Topically , the Option School quantitativ e liter ature has o verwhelmingly focused on
individual students too often char acterizing them as beha viorally deviant and
academically unmotiv ated (Arno ve & Strout, 1980; Escobar -Chaveset al. , 2002;
Selman, 2017).This deriv es from and further reinforces the r ace ev asive, rational, and
closed approach to studying Option Schools. Lastly , while quantitativ e administr ative
data has widely been used to understand school discipline pr actice, such studies
gener ally ex clude Option Schools, fail to examine tr ansfer to Option Schools as a
potentially ex clusionary outcome, and are unable to offer insight regarding the
underlying processes through which students in different social positions are tr ansferred
to Option Schools. T o address these critical methodological and topical gaps, this mix ed
methods explanatory sequential design to answer a series of research questions. These
topical and methodological gaps ha ve left districts without a meaningful understanding
of how students end up in Option School settings, how the existence of Option Schools
influences pr actice in neighborhood schools, and how the Option School tr ansfer process
affects schooling as a formativ e experience for families.","to Date

Reflectiv e Memo: The R ole of T ransition Specialists and the T ransfer Process
This document does not contain research findings, direct quotes, or conclusiv e
implications. This memo is a broad reflection from interviews with tr ansition specialists
on their role and the tr ansition process.
The R ole of the T ransition Specialist
Transition Specialists described their role as adv ocacy and brok ering across
stakeholders (e.g. school staff , network staff , parents, and students) during a short,
critical moment in a student ’s trajectory .
Advocacy work primarily focused on informing parents and students of their educational
rights as well as facilitating parents’ choice (i.e. remain in the mainstream school or
transfer to an Options School). Since the majorit y of requests come from the Options
Schools, T ransition Specialists reflected on doing a lot of information gathering to learn
more about how the student and their parents arriv ed at the Options School. In these
cases T ransition Specialists informed the parents that they ha ve the right to remain at
the mainstream school if they choose or enroll in an Options School. Some T ransition
Specialists described going to the mainstream school with the parent and student to
support them in sta ying at their mainstream school or coordinating with parents to ha ve
a student enroll in Options Schools with the goal of returning to a CPS mainstream
school.
Working Within the Network
Transition Specialists reflected that working within their networks enabled them to build
rapport with colleagues, work collabor atively within other network staff , and be more
effectiv e in their role. Specifically , transition specialists work ed closely with network
Chiefs and other network staff to implement the policy . This included adding network
Chiefs onto emails to encour age responses from school staff and working with network
staff to support schools in prev enting tr ansfer . Further , their work within the network
helped mak e network staff more a ware of Options Schools and the policy .
The Options School Network
Transition Specialists described their role as being a bridge between the district and
Options Schools as well as being a bridge between schools and network staff regarding
the tr ansfer policy . Howev er, Transition Specialists reflected concerns about the opacit y
of Options Schools and not being able to support the student past 5 weeks of
enrollment at the Options Schools. T ransition Specialists reflected hope that the new
Options School network increases accountabilit y for Options Schools and enables the
district to understand what happens to students once they enroll.
The T ransfer Process
The majorit y of requests come from Options Schools, r ather than through Aspen. Giv en
this context, the T ransition Specialists described their position as a complex one- while
they ha ve the abilit y to appro ve or den y transfer they do not ha ve any abilit y to enforce
the policy . Though bringing in network leadership at specific moments has been helpful,
Transition Specialists reflected the policy is not y et implemented as intended. Signs of
this include substantially fewer tr ansfer requests being submitted through Aspen from
the sending school and limited opportunities to create support plans for students to
remain in mainstream schools. T ransition Specialists reflected that this limits their
ability to prev ent tr ansfer , as they are engaging students’ cases when they already
arrived at the Options Schools. This puts them in a position of interv ention r ather than
prevention, which while critical does not reflect the full capacit y of the policy .
Suggestions
The 24 Hour Time Limit on Appro val Requests or DenialsTransition Specialists described the 24 hour window as a barrier to their work.
Specifically because it limited their abilit y to do the core components of their work -
advocacy and engaging stak eholders, particularly parents and students. T ransition
Specialists reflected that parents are t ypically at work and students are often in school,
at work, or not reachable within the 24 hour period. The T ransition Specialists stated
that students often do not enroll in an Options School within 24 hours, so extending the
time fr ame to 48 hours would lik ely not place barriers for students. Lastly , the T ransition
Specialists reflected that den ying tr ansfers when they are not able to engage parents
and students is not pr actical in their workflow .
Understanding What Services are Offered in Each School
Transition Specialists reflected that it w as difficult to know what a vailable services within
each mainstream school are, what these services do for students, and how accessible
these services are for the population of students most lik ely to tr ansfer to Options
Schools. The T ransition Specialists reflected that this information would be useful in
their partnership with schools and their abilit y to support students sta y in mainstream
schools.
More Credit R ecovery Interv entions Offered Within the District
Transition Specialists reflected a desire for a wider v ariety of effectiv e, targeted
academic credit reco very services for students. Specifically , that there are students who
need support catching up on credits and that it would be ideal if T ransition Specialists
had a v ariety of interv entions they could connect students to within their mainstream
school or within the district.
More Structured Time with T ransition Specialists and with District Leadership
The T ransition Specialists reflected a desire to ha ve more structured time with each
other and more time to speak with district leadership about implementation of the
policy . This time to share out would help them share str ategies about what is effectiv e
across networks and engage district leadership about policy implementation to increase
the policy’ s abilit y to create change.

Please check all of the following that apply to your research protocol:
Interviews
Observ ations
Secondary Data R equestPlease outline your protocol for individual interview activities, describing when,
where, duration, frequency, and with whom.
To understand participants’ experiences in the tr ansfer process, the team will conduct
semi-structured interviews with district tr ansfer specialists and up to 60 school staff
(60-90 minutes) at fiv e time points o ver the course of 2022-2023. In addition,
interviews with up to 60 students/guardians (60 minutes, conducted separ ately or
together) will occur at fiv e time points o ver the course of 2022-2023.
Does this involve video, audio, or photograph recording?
Yes
Please describe the protocol for audio/video recording
Qualitativ e data will be collected remotely , at CPS school sites, or at communit y sites in
accordance with CPS policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. If students remain in CPS
run schools, and do not tr ansfer to Options Schools, the interviews will be conducted in a
CPS school. The interviews and observ ations will be recorded (via a recorder if in-
person, via Z oom if remote for staff , or via Google Hangouts with CPS staff present if
remote for student interviews). Samantha Guz under the supervision of Da vid Johnson
will be collecting the qualitativ e data (observ ations and interviews). The interviews with
district staff and school staff will tak e no more than 90 minutes howev er, in pr actice we
anticipate that CPS staff will not ha ve 90 minutes of time to giv e a single interview .
Additionally , there is reason to believ e there are tempor al elements to Options School
transfer . Therefore staff will complete 5 interviews o ver the course of 2022-2023. The
guardians and students will be interviewed 5 times beginning when a tr ansfer request is
submitted and throughout the academic y ear. Each interview will tak e no more than 60
minutes. Howev er, similar to CPS staff , we understand that students and their families
may not ha ve 60 minutes to giv e at a single time point. Therefore they will be able to
participate in the time they ha ve allotted to the interview . Our intention is to giv e
participants the opportunit y to participate in the research process as fully as they would
like to while also not creating hea vy burdens to participation.
UChicago Consortium project staff will obtain adult participants' v erbal consent via email
or phone at the time of recruitment and pro vide a line for activ e consent on a ph ysical
consent form or remotely using an application such as REDcap . Consent for adult
participants will be discussed both at recruitment and at the time of the interview . In
both instances, participants will be giv en an opportunit y to ask an y questions and/or
have any concerns addressed. Adult participants will be reminded at the time of the
interview that their participation is v oluntary and that they can withdr aw their consent to
participate at an y time without penalt y. Participants will be ask ed if they ha ve any
questions at the beginning and will be told that their rights as a participant which
includes stopping the interview to ask a clarif ying question.
If a participant opts out of participation, all qualitativ e data related to that individual will
be deleted from the tr anscript and will not be used for an y future research purposes.
CPS tr aining will be recorded and tr anscribed with the original recording being stored on
the secure, encrypted serv er. The original recordings will be k ept on the serv er for
research purposes and with all participants deidentified in the tr anscripts. Specifically
any identif ying information such as name and ph ysical descriptors will be deleted from
the tr anscript. Identif ying information about participants will be stored on the secure,
encrypted serv er in a password lock ed spreadsheet. The spreadsheet (i.e. crossw alk) will
be used for administr ative reasons (i.e. tr acking activ e consent and opting out) and will
have no research purpose. If a tr aining has already occurred we will get retroactiv e
consent from the CPS emplo yee pro viding the tr aining.
For high school students written assent will be obtained at the time of recruitment and
that assent will be confirmed at the time of interview . Students will be giv en an
opportunit y to ask an y questions and/or ha ve any concerns addressed. P articipants will
be reminded at the time of the interview that their participation is v oluntary and that
they can withdr aw their consent to participate at an y time without penalt y. Participantswill be ask ed if they ha ve any questions at the beginning and will be told that their rights
as a participant which includes stopping the interview to ask a clarif ying question. This
proposal includes no focus groups with students.
The researcher will be introduced to the guardians and students through district staff . As
a result, CPS staff will be the a venue of recruitment for guardians and staff , the
researchers will not recruit guardian and student participants through CPS without going
through a CPS staff member .
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
Qualitativ e research data (e.g. audio files) are recorded using hand-held digital
recorders or Z oom's record feature. A udio files are stored on digital recorders while
researchers are in tr ansit from field sites to the office. In the case of Z oom interviews or
observ ations the tr ansfer process to the secure serv er can happen immediately after the
interview . Researchers will upload all audio files to the secure, encrypted serv er as soon
as ph ysically possible after conducting an interview . After an audio file has been
uploaded to the serv er, the file will be deleted from the digital recorder . To ensure
confidentialit y is maintained, ev en in the ev en that a recorder is lost or stolen,
researchers will refer to schools b y pseudon yms and research participants b y alpha-
numeric code only at all times while conducting their interviews. Giv en her dual role in
the project, Megan Hougard will not ha ve access to an y of the qualitativ e data
(recordings or tr anscripts).

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the
motivation, design, and implications of the project.
This project seeks to understand the impact of recent reforms to CPS’ s transfer policy
for students mo ving from neighborhood high schools into Options schools. It consists of
four data analysis activities: 1) understanding the shifting dynamics of tr ansferring
students before and after the reform using secondary student -level data, 2) exploring
the perspectiv es of students, families, and school personnel engaged in the new
transfer process, 3) char acterizing the current and ev olving school-lev el supports for
students considering tr ansfer , and 4) assessing the policy implementation process via
procedur al records and 30 process observ ations. Original data collection will occur
Winter 2022 - Summer 2023; secondary data will span 2008 - 2023 as a vailable
Although CPS has long-standing research-pr actice collabor ations, historically most of
that research has not included Option Schools or the tr ansfer into Option Schools. Due
to the opacit y of Option Schools, it is difficult for the district to ha ve a clear
understanding of how students are tr ansferred to Option Schools, under what
circumstances this tr ansfer occurs, and what services CPS students receiv e once they
enroll in an Option School. Therefore, this project will pro vide CPS with A) essential
information about the patterns of Option School tr ansfer , B) meaningful insight into how
the tr ansfer policy is implemented b y neighborhood schools, C) critical knowledge about
how students and their guardians experience and engage with the tr ansfer process, and
D) immediately actionable insights regarding how the tr ansfer process might be
strengthened and how/where resources might be best applied to reduce tr ansfer out of
neighborhood schools. The Option School tr ansfer policy outcome and process
evaluation is being dev eloped in partnership with CPS stak eholders including Megan
Hougard and Molly Mik olajczyk. The collabor ation ensures that the ev aluation
foregrounds analyz es that are going to be meaningful to district policy and education
practice.Research Questions and Hypothesis

conversations in education scholarship , policy , and public discourse. Notably , the
authors refer to the experiences of Option School students as the in visible ‘wedge’
between these two , otherwise well studied phenomena. This mix ed methods research
project, submitted in partnership with staff at Chicago Public Schools (CPS), aims to
address the in visibilit y of these students’ experiences through an outcome and process
evaluation of the updated Option School tr ansfer policy:
1. How does expanded a vailabilit y of Options School placements impact school discipline
practice in neighborhood schools? (Secondary student -level data)
2. How does increased o versight from the district and standardization of pre-tr ansfer
requirements shift (a) the number of students who tr ansfer , (b) the risk profiles of
students tr ansferring into Option Schools, and (c) school attendance and continued
enrollment among those most lik ely to tr ansfer? (Secondary student -level data)
3. How do district and school personnel conceptualiz e the sets of services that can
appropriately be pro vided b y neighborhood schools? What t ypes of student needs do
district and school personnel understand as best met in an alternativ e setting?
(Interviews, Observ ations, Procedur al Records)
4. How do students and their guardian(s) experience and engage with the reformed
transfer policy? (Interviews & Observ ations)Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What
is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the
body of extant knowledge?
Option Schools sit at the nexus of sev eral areas of contempor ary education discourses
on racial str atification, including the systematic push-out of Black students and students
with disabilities (George, 2015), school accountabilit y (Fedders, 2018), and school
choice. In a recent study Ewing, Da vis & Guz (2021) documented that the experiences
of Option School students form a ‘wedge’ between these otherwise well-studied
phenomena. T o demonstr ate, while outright school expulsion is relativ ely rare (0.2% of
students; de Brey et al. , 2019) and suspension pr actices in mainstream schools ha ve
been the focus of extensiv e study (Sulliv an, Van Norman & Klingbeil,2014; Steinberg &
Lacoe, 2018), the 3% of high school students who tr ansfer to an Option School are
largely absent from academic liter ature and policy discourse (Carv er, Lewis & Tice,
2010).
This research project aims to pro vide methodological and topical inno vations to the
existing Option School academic and pr actice liter ature. First, methodologically ,
research on Option Schools has not used district administr ative data to quantitativ ely
evaluate district policy or inform qualitativ e approaches. The majorit y of the secondary
quantitativ e Option School liter ature used national or state lev el data whereas primary
quantitativ e research t ypically sampled a single Option School site (Guz et al. , in
prepar ation). As a result, the quantitativ e liter ature lacks the depth offered b y a
systems perspectiv e and place-based analysis. Further , although the liter ature is mainly
qualitativ e, the majorit y of the qualitativ e research does not engage with critical
theories, has not included the family of Option School students, and has primarily
collected interview data at single time points. This is limiting, as schooling is not an
individual student experience or static experience, it is a gener ational and communal
experience ev olves over time and place.
Topically , the Option School quantitativ e liter ature has o verwhelmingly focused on
individual students too often char acterizing them as beha viorally deviant and
academically unmotiv ated (Arno ve & Strout, 1980; Escobar -Chaveset al. , 2002;
Selman, 2017).This deriv es from and further reinforces the r ace ev asive, rational, and
closed approach to studying Option Schools. Lastly , while quantitativ e administr ative
data has widely been used to understand school discipline pr actice, such studies
gener ally ex clude Option Schools, fail to examine tr ansfer to Option Schools as a
potentially ex clusionary outcome, and are unable to offer insight regarding the
underlying processes through which students in different social positions are tr ansferred
to Option Schools. T o address these critical methodological and topical gaps, this mix ed
methods explanatory sequential design to answer a series of research questions. These
topical and methodological gaps ha ve left districts without a meaningful understanding
of how students end up in Option School settings, how the existence of Option Schools
influences pr actice in neighborhood schools, and how the Option School tr ansfer process
affects schooling as a formativ e experience for families.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated
with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will
be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
To understand participants’ experiences in the tr ansfer process, the team will conduct
semi-structured interviews with district tr ansfer specialists and up to 60 school staff
(60-90 minutes) at fiv e time points o ver the course of the academic y ear. In addition,
interviews with up to 60 students/guardians (60 minutes, conducted separ ately or
together) will occur at fiv e time points o ver the course of 2022-2023. . Due to COVID-
19, staff interviews ma y be conducted via Z oom and student/guardian interviews ma y
be conducted via Google Hangouts. Process observ ations and procedur al document
collection (including materials created prior to the study period) will be spread through
the study period. 30 observ ations with school staff will be conducted. Specifically
observ ations of the tr ansition specialists implementing the tr ansfer policy as well as
school staff implementing the tr ansfer policy . In these observ ations of school staff
possible that a school staff member will be speaking with students with or without
guardians.
Researchers will analyz e data from Chicago Public Schools administr ative records
(2008-09 through 2023-24). These data are pro vided to the UChicago Consortium b y
the Chicago Public Schools under the terms of an existing data sharing agreement.
These data are restricted access and are not publicly a vailable. W e will use a unique
student identifier - no names or S SNs are part of the data. R esearchers will not be able
identif y the students based on their research identifier , it will be used for research
purposes only . We will ha ve access to demogr aphic information, student academic
performance on tests and GP A, student perceptions of school climate, student discipline
records (e.g. , suspensions), student school attendance, student special education
status, and school enrollment. The core analysis will be on gr ades 9-12, although K -8
data will be used to understand students’ prior academic tr ajectories. These data files
are already held at CCSR / routinely tr ansferred to CCSR under the umbrella data
sharing agreement, and will be analyz ed as outlined in the Statement of W ork for the
project.
In addition, researchers will analyz e data being collected as part of the newly -created
district tr ansfer specialists’ regular job duties. F or each student considering tr ansfer ,
specialists are collecting information about services pro vided and reasons for tr ansfer .
Additionally , transfer specialists will collect the responses of school staff to tr ansfer case
vignettes to better understand school pr actice. This data will be aggregate and not at
the staff -level. Lastly , for each high school, specialists are collecting information on the
variety of student support progr amming a vailable. These data need to be collected in
order for the newly -created district tr ansfer specialists to perform their routine job
activities and support the long-run goal of pro viding appropriate student supports within
neighborhood schools. The project team is pro viding technical assistance to build data
collection capacit y in a w ay that 1) reduces administr ative burden, 2) can be readily
maintained long bey ond the study period, and 3) creates data systems that support
district long-term monitoring and ev aluation goals. Data files will be tr ansferred directly

We will interview teachers about their experiences implementing their lessons throughout each
semester . These meetings ma y occur in person or via Z oom and will be recorded. These
interviews will be tr anscribed for analysis.","Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the motivation,
design, and implications of the project.
This project will build upon the successful Geospatial Semester ( GSS) high school course to
explore how to infuse a powerful STEM tool into Career and T echnical Education (CTE) and AP
courses in CPS . Geospatial Semester is a y ear-long course for high school seniors. The course,
which is currently taught in Virginia, focuses on dev eloping geospatial problem-solving skills
using state-of -the-art visualization softw are and applying those skills to extended local
problems chosen b y the students. Students receiv e dual enrollment credit at James Madison
University (JMU). The efficacy of the GS S has been demonstr ated in a v ariety of studies.
Participation in the GS S has been shown to impro ve students’ real- world spatial problem solving
as well as their core spatial abilities as measured b y both cognitiv e and neurocognitiv e
assessments. In this project teachers will adapt and implement GS S in a v ariety of CTE clusters
and social science courses in CPS . We propose to conduct research on the implementation of
the Geospatial Semester in the different course contexts to understand how the progr am
supports student learning.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Our work is motiv ated b y two research questions, which are focused on whether , and how , the
GSS can be adapted to the needs of a large, urban district teaching a v ariety of CTE related
skills:
 
1. How can large urban school districts dev elop the necessary infr astructure to implement
Geospatial Semester without the direct support of the dev elopers?
 
During the 2021-22 school y ear, we will continue to engage in co-design with teachers and
design-based research to dev elop an implementation model that is tailored to CPS’ s CTE
curriculum and supported b y continuing professional dev elopment pr actices. 
 
2. Can we dev elop classroom-based assessments of spatial reasoning that ha ve con vergent
validity with the research-based measures used in past research? 
 
The efficacy of GS S has been established through research-based measures, which are
impractical for use as classroom assessments. W e have dev eloped a set of classroom
assessments and will in vestigate whether these assessments ha ve con vergent v alidity with
the research-based measures.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is the
contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body of extant
knowledge?
At the core of GS S is the dev elopment of spatial thinking, which pla ys a v ery important role in
the learning and pr actice of STEM and CTE. Man y of the most important disco veries in science
involved a critical spatial insight, such as the structure of the Benz ene ring or the DNA
molecule. Spatial skills are strongly predictiv e of achiev ement, persistence, and attainment in
STEM field, ev en after accounting for other relev ant variables such as mathematical and v erbal
aptitude. In some STEM fields (e.g. , engineering), spatial abilit y contributes more unique
variance than S AT scores to the prediction of achiev ement and attainment. Evidence linking
spatial abilit y and future STEM attainment is ex ceptionally strong, co vering 50 y ears of research
with more than 400,000 participants, and multiple datasets con verging on v ery similar
conclusions.
Spatial thinking also will pla y a critically important role in the emplo yment of students who are
currently in high school. The U .S. Department of Labor identified geospatial technologies as one
of the three technology sectors that will grow most quickly o ver the next decade, along with
nanotechnology and biotechnology . Furthermore, enhancing spatial thinking ma y be v ery
important for increasing the access to STEM-related jobs b y women. R eported sex differences in
spatial reasoning that fa vor males ha ve often been cited as one, of man y, factors that
contribute to the underrepresentation of females in STEM. Howev er, this disparit y can
sometimes be o vercome through spatial tr aining, which appears to be highly effectiv e in
impro ving spatial cognition in girls. Despite the evidence supporting the benefits of GIS , it has
not made significant inroads to the core subjects in K12. The omission of spatial learning from
the Common Core math standards and the Next Gener ation Science Standards leads to
incomplete understanding of topics that ha ve a spatial underpinning, an inabilit y to mak e
meaning from spatial representations, and a lack of critical thinking - precisely the kinds of
skills that students in the US need to succeed in the 21st Century .
 The GS S addresses this omission b y providing students with the opportunit y to dev elop the
spatial reasoning skills that underpin success in STEM disciplines and a v ariety of CTE path ways.
GSS helps students dev elop core spatial abilities that are tr aditionally measured using
psychometric tests.  These include mentally rotating figures, imaging folds in paper , and finding
specific geometric shapes embedded within complex figures.  Howev er, what mak es GS S unique
is that it builds on these core spatial abilities to dev elop higher -level spatial reasoning and
problem-solving abilities in the form of STEM-relev ant educational outcomes. F oremost among
these is a “spatial habit of mind.“ This means learning to think about STEM-related questions in
terms of spatial relations between structures. Students must come to think of spatial solutions
and pr actices as means to finding solutions for challenging science and engineering problems.
For example, when approaching a no vel problem, students with successful spatial learning
experiences should conceiv e of new problems as fundamentally spatial in nature, and potentially
solvable in spatial w ays. Moreo ver, they should know and understand str ategies for the use of
spatial evidence, and for the selection and visualization of data, to support scientific reasoning.
A key element of gaining this know -how is that students must learn and engage with the
spatially -based technologies that perv ade much of modern STEM (e.g. GIS) . Developing these
abilities represents a tr ansformational change in the w ay students think about STEM problems
and the cognitiv e and technological tools they bring to bear , and our ev aluation data pro vide
encour aging evidence that the GS S can bring about this tr ansformativ e change.","to Date
During the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021 school y ears, teachers co-designed and
implemented a set of GIS-infused lessons, focused on map building and analysis with content -
relevant topics. The research team conducted classroom observ ations when GIS-infused lessons
were being implemented with the goal of identif ying components of GIS-infused instruction that
contribute to student engagement and learning, particularly GIS technical abilities, spatial
reasoning skills, and content understandings, in this context. Data from the observ ations
include field notes, lesson materials, student work, and video for teachers and students who
consented to participate in the research. Additionally , debriefing sessions were conducted with
teachers to gener ate their reflections on the design and implementation process. R esearch team
debriefing sessions were then conducted to analyz e the data and gener ate design principles,
implementation recommendations, and supports for prev alent challenges. Ov er summer 2023,
we work ed with a teacher to dev elop GIS lessons for AP US History . He is implementing the
lessons for school y ear 2022-2023, and we are collecting pre-post assessments and surv eys in
his two AP US History classes.
Starting in 2021, we dev eloped a GIS-based v ersion of the Exploring Computer Science (ECS)
Unit 5 data unit. F or school y ear 2021-2022, we conducted a 3 session sequence of professional
development for ECS computer science teachers as an introduction to the unit. T wo of the
sessions were online after school. These were attended b y 10 ECS teachers. W e also conducted
an in-person after school GIS tutorial session for three teachers. Fiv e of the teachers went on to
implement the GIS-based Unit 5. Students in four classrooms completed pre-post assessments
and surv eys. F or school y ear 2022-2023, we conducted two in-person professional dev elopment
sessions, which were attended b y 27 ECS teachers. Three teachers went on to implement the
ECS unit and their students completed pre-post assessments and surv eys. Ov er summer 2023,
we work ed with one ECS teacher and a GIS expert to revise ECS Unit 5, and we aim to offer
another professional dev elopment session this fall/winter .Preliminary Results to Date
Based on our work from 2018-2021, we presented two papers
(https://repository .isls.org/bitstream/1/6302/1/1111-1117.pdf ,
https://repository .isls.org/bitstream/1/7469/1/219-226.pdf ). Overall, fiv e design principles
emerged from the our design-based research observ ations and debriefing process: (1) student -
driven inquiry , (2) cultur ally responsiv e instruction, (3) foregrounding spatial reasoning, (4)
connecting to disciplinary content, and (5) creating a collabor ative communit y of learners. (1)
Drawing from learner -centered design (Br ansford, Brown, & Cocking, 1999), student -driven
inquiry in this context in volves students taking the lead in learning GIS through “guided
discovery”. This in volves students choosing their own questions, exploring the GIS functions and
analyses they need to answer those questions, and figuring out how to use them. T eachers can
provide constr aints, such as v etted topics or data options, to scaffold this process. (2) Cultur ally
responsiv e instruction is grounded in and relev ant to students’ liv es and communit y cultures
(Ladson-Billings, 1995; Lee, 2004) and lev erages students’ funds of knowledge (e.g. González,
Moll, & Amanti, 2006). In this context, lessons should incorpor ate GIS in w ays that connect
content to students’ liv es, experiences, and communities, creating connections between
content -relev ant issues and prior knowledge. (3) F oregrounding spatial reasoning with GIS
involves creating opportunities for students to reason about wh y things are where they are and
why that matters for the topic they are in vestigating (e.g. , Uttal, Miller , & Newcombe, 2013).
(4) GIS-infused lessons should also be rooted in and deeply connected to disciplinary content
(e.g. Mishr a & K oehler , 2006). This in volves using GIS to in vestigate topics, including course-
relevant models and concepts, that enable students to build or deepen course-relev ant
understandings, r ather than learning GIS technical skills in isolation. (5) Finally , GIS lessons can
be challenging in that they in volve learning new habits of mind while na vigating unfamiliar ,
complex technology and, as such, should be situated in a collabor ative communit y of learners
(e.g. Brown & Campione, 1994). This in volves creating a culture of safet y, in which errors are
framed as productiv e learning opportunities, and normalizing the struggle of learning GIS .
Guided b y these design principles, we adapted the Learning for Use (LFU) fr amework (Edelson,
2001) to pro vide detailed guidance to support the design and implementation of GIS-infused
instruction. LFU is a fr amework for the design of technology -supported inquiry tasks. LFU has
three main phases: motiv ate, construct, and refine. Briefly , motiv ate tasks create a demand for
knowledge and elicit curiosit y by revealing important gaps in learners’ skills and
understandings. Construct activities in volve experiencing and observing phenomena using
disciplinary tools for inquiry and communicating with others about those phenomena for
purposes of building new knowledge. R efine projects enable learners to apply their
understanding in meaningful w ays and pro vide opportunities for metacognitiv e reflection.
The design fr amework and principles were introduced to new and continuing teachers at the
beginning of the 2nd y ear workshops as teachers began redesigns of their GIS-infused courses.
Teachers, mentors, and researchers are currently applying these supports to iter atively redesign
existing lessons and co-design new lessons. They are also co-designing course maps that la y
out a y ear-long sequence of GIS-infused lessons that aligns with the GIS-based LFU fr amework.
The course maps pinpoint which units those lessons align with in their course. This y ear,
teachers are implementing new and refined lessons and we are continuing to analyz e this work
using a DBR approach.
As for our work in Exploring Computer Science classes from 2021-2023, we ha ve presented on
paper and submitted a second. Students’ engagement with geogr aphic information systems
(GIS) can impro ve spatial skills, which are predictors of STEM success (Jant et al. , 2019). W e
used a surv ey motiv ated b y Eccles’ s (2009) expectancy -value-cost fr amework to assess
students’ perceptions of their computer science (CS) courses before and after participation in a
GIS unit. The unit pro vided opportunities to apply GIS to inquiry -based projects focused on
solving problems in their own communities. Across four teachers in the 2021-2022 school y ear,
158 students participated in the GIS unit and completed the surv ey. We found that students’
reports of classroom equit y predicted their expectancy of success in and v alue of CS and their
desire to tak e additional CS courses or major in CS . We also found that students’ performance
on a geospatial problem-solving assessment impro ved from pre-test to post -test. As for school
year 2022-2023, across three teachers, 134 students participated in the GIS unit and
completed the assessment. W e found that students’ performance on a geospatial thinking
significantly increased from pre- to post -test. W e also found that students who participated in
more GIS lessons and whose teachers had more GIS experience used more spatial and GIS-
related language than students who participated in fewer lesson or whose teachers had less GIS
experience. W e are now considering the impacts of teacher tr aining and lesson implementation
practices on students’ geospatial thinking, and we are using this information to impro ve
professional dev elopment opportunities and lesson implementation.Type of Request

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the motivation,
design, and implications of the project.
This project will build upon the successful Geospatial Semester ( GSS) high school course to
explore how to infuse a powerful STEM tool into Career and T echnical Education (CTE) and AP
courses in CPS . Geospatial Semester is a y ear-long course for high school seniors. The course,
which is currently taught in Virginia, focuses on dev eloping geospatial problem-solving skills
using state-of -the-art visualization softw are and applying those skills to extended local
problems chosen b y the students. Students receiv e dual enrollment credit at James Madison
University (JMU). The efficacy of the GS S has been demonstr ated in a v ariety of studies.
Participation in the GS S has been shown to impro ve students’ real- world spatial problem solving
as well as their core spatial abilities as measured b y both cognitiv e and neurocognitiv e
assessments. In this project teachers will adapt and implement GS S in a v ariety of CTE clusters
and social science courses in CPS . We propose to conduct research on the implementation of
the Geospatial Semester in the different course contexts to understand how the progr am
supports student learning.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Our work is motiv ated b y two research questions, which are focused on whether , and how , the
GSS can be adapted to the needs of a large, urban district teaching a v ariety of CTE related
skills:
 
1. How can large urban school districts dev elop the necessary infr astructure to implement
Geospatial Semester without the direct support of the dev elopers?
 
During the 2021-22 school y ear, we will continue to engage in co-design with teachers and
design-based research to dev elop an implementation model that is tailored to CPS’ s CTE
curriculum and supported b y continuing professional dev elopment pr actices. 
 
2. Can we dev elop classroom-based assessments of spatial reasoning that ha ve con vergent
validity with the research-based measures used in past research? 
 
The efficacy of GS S has been established through research-based measures, which are
impractical for use as classroom assessments. W e have dev eloped a set of classroom
assessments and will in vestigate whether these assessments ha ve con vergent v alidity with
the research-based measures.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is the
contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body of extant
knowledge?
At the core of GS S is the dev elopment of spatial thinking, which pla ys a v ery important role in
the learning and pr actice of STEM and CTE. Man y of the most important disco veries in science
involved a critical spatial insight, such as the structure of the Benz ene ring or the DNA
molecule. Spatial skills are strongly predictiv e of achiev ement, persistence, and attainment in
STEM field, ev en after accounting for other relev ant variables such as mathematical and v erbal
aptitude. In some STEM fields (e.g. , engineering), spatial abilit y contributes more unique
variance than S AT scores to the prediction of achiev ement and attainment. Evidence linking
spatial abilit y and future STEM attainment is ex ceptionally strong, co vering 50 y ears of research
with more than 400,000 participants, and multiple datasets con verging on v ery similar
conclusions.
Spatial thinking also will pla y a critically important role in the emplo yment of students who are
currently in high school. The U .S. Department of Labor identified geospatial technologies as one
of the three technology sectors that will grow most quickly o ver the next decade, along with
nanotechnology and biotechnology . Furthermore, enhancing spatial thinking ma y be v ery
important for increasing the access to STEM-related jobs b y women. R eported sex differences in
spatial reasoning that fa vor males ha ve often been cited as one, of man y, factors that
contribute to the underrepresentation of females in STEM. Howev er, this disparit y can
sometimes be o vercome through spatial tr aining, which appears to be highly effectiv e in
impro ving spatial cognition in girls. Despite the evidence supporting the benefits of GIS , it has
not made significant inroads to the core subjects in K12. The omission of spatial learning from
the Common Core math standards and the Next Gener ation Science Standards leads to
incomplete understanding of topics that ha ve a spatial underpinning, an inabilit y to mak e
meaning from spatial representations, and a lack of critical thinking - precisely the kinds of
skills that students in the US need to succeed in the 21st Century .
 The GS S addresses this omission b y providing students with the opportunit y to dev elop the
spatial reasoning skills that underpin success in STEM disciplines and a v ariety of CTE path ways.
GSS helps students dev elop core spatial abilities that are tr aditionally measured using
psychometric tests.  These include mentally rotating figures, imaging folds in paper , and finding
specific geometric shapes embedded within complex figures.  Howev er, what mak es GS S unique
is that it builds on these core spatial abilities to dev elop higher -level spatial reasoning and
problem-solving abilities in the form of STEM-relev ant educational outcomes. F oremost among
these is a “spatial habit of mind.“ This means learning to think about STEM-related questions in
terms of spatial relations between structures. Students must come to think of spatial solutions
and pr actices as means to finding solutions for challenging science and engineering problems.
For example, when approaching a no vel problem, students with successful spatial learning
experiences should conceiv e of new problems as fundamentally spatial in nature, and potentially
solvable in spatial w ays. Moreo ver, they should know and understand str ategies for the use of
spatial evidence, and for the selection and visualization of data, to support scientific reasoning.
A key element of gaining this know -how is that students must learn and engage with the
spatially -based technologies that perv ade much of modern STEM (e.g. GIS) . Developing these
abilities represents a tr ansformational change in the w ay students think about STEM problems
and the cognitiv e and technological tools they bring to bear , and our ev aluation data pro vide
encour aging evidence that the GS S can bring about this tr ansformativ e change.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated with this
study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will be asked of your
research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)

Relevant artifacts (e.g. lesson plans, student work) will be collected.
Teacher ma y engage in a post implementation interview outside of school time.   
Participants will be recruited via email using a script. An email in viting students in
Geospatial Semester classes to participate will be sent to each student and
parent/guardian b y the student ’s teacher . Online consent forms will be presented via
Google F orms. The recruitment email will include a link to the online remote learning
consent form. Students and parents/guardians will complete the assent/consent forms
from their personal electronic devices. On the online consent and assent forms, students
and parents will indicate consent/assent b y selecting the research activities they agree to
participate in and signing and dating the consent/assent form. If needed for v erification
purposes, The Learning P artnership will mak e the list of consenting parents/guardians
available to CPS so that a sample of parent/guardian consents can be v erified through a
follow up phone call.

ACT Now is the recipient of two Department of Education State Scaling Gr ants for
Full Service Communit y Schools (FSCS) for FY2024-2028. They are partnering with
eight districts and 16 schools that are designated as Title 1, and an additional eight
districts and 16 schools that are based in R ural areas across Illinois to implement
services and progr amming aligned with the Communit y School Model. The model
consists of pipeline (existing) services and progr ams related to the four model
pillars, including: 1) integr ated student supports, 2) expanded and enriched
learning time, 3) family and communit y engagement, and 4) collabor ative
leadership and pr actices. Communit y schools are a k ey str ategy in working tow ards
increasing accessibilit y and equit y as partnerships serv e to address systemic
barriers that limit opportunities for children and families. The communit y schools
model pro vides additional support b y leveraging communit y resources that meet
the full needs of students so they can focus on learning. Communit y schools serv e
to close educational attainment gaps as they pro vide access to expanded and
enriched learning time opportunities. In Illinois, communit y schools ha ve shown:
impro ved grades, greater student interest in schools, impro ved attendance, a
greater feeling of prepar ation for college and career , impro ved academic
performance, increased gr aduation r ates, and impro ved standardiz ed tests scores.
In addition to academic gains, communit y schools ha ve also pro ven to increase
youth social-emotional skills and beha viors. The integr ated supports built into the

What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build
upon the body of extant knowledge?
Youth and families in Illinois face daily obstacles in accessing comprehensiv e
opportunities and achieving student success. T raditional public schools and
afterschool progr ams do not ha ve the capacit y to fully meet the needs of y outh,
especially giv en the increased need for supports following COVID-19 pandemic.
Statewide assessment data shows that students in Illinois consistently perform
below expected lev els, including the national a verage. F ourth-gr ade academic
proficiency is a crucial mark er of educational dev elopment where students are using
their reading skills as a critical component of learning other subjects. Children who
reach the fourth gr ade without ha ving proficient reading skills are more lik ely to
drop out of high school, reducing their potential opportunities in the workforce. In
2019, 34% of fourth gr aders in Illinois scored at a proficient reading lev el. This w as
in line with the national a verage, howev er, this o verall low lev el of performance
translated into lower -than- average scores in math and science. In 2019, Illinois
fourth gr aders presented an a verage math score of 237, three points lower than the
national a verage. Further , only 38% of students performed at a proficient math
level, a decrease from 2017 results. The a verage science score in 2015 for Illinois
fourth gr aders (151) w as also lower than the national a verage (153) and
demonstr ated a smaller r ate of proficient students (35%) than the nation (38%). 
In addition to academic deficits faced b y students in FSCS partner districts, man y
students also demonstr ate risky academic beha viors such as: 
Chronic absenteeism—Ov erall, Illinois’ state chronic absenteeism has increased b y
12% compared to pre-pandemic lev els. Chicago Public Schools reported a chronic
absenteeism r ate of 45% during the 2021-2022 school y ear, and both CUSD4 and
USD5 districts reported a r ate of 25%. In the named school districts, and statewide,
Black students reported the highest r ate of absenteeism, followed b y
Hispanic/Latino students, and White students. 
Chronic T ruancy —Statewide, the chronic truancy r ate w as 22% for the 2021-2022
school y ear. Rates in CPS , CUSD4, and USD5 surpass the state a verage, reporting
52%, 25%, and 26%, respectiv ely. In the named school districts, and statewide,
Black students reported the highest r ate of truancy , followed b y Hispanic students,
and White students. 
Youth in Illinois ha ve also shown a great need for mental health, social-emotional
interv entions, and increased access to ph ysical healthcare. Since 2015, the o verall
state r ank for y outh mental health has dropped b y 17 places, lea ving Illinois at r ank
36 in 2021. In addition, man y youth experiencing the need for professional mental
health services do not receiv e treatment. F or example, y outh with a major
depressiv e episode within the reporting y ear who did not receiv e treatment
increased from 56% in 2020 to 62% in 2021. Much of this can be attributed to a 
lack of accessibilit y to treatment —18% of parents in Chicago reported that they
could not access the services they w anted for their child. Y outh are also
experiencing ph ysical health hardships and engaging in risky beha viors that ma y
lead to adv erse outcomes. P oor health in childhood leads to negativ e results in
school readiness and lasting difficulties for future health. The Kids Count Data
Center placed Illinois’ health r anking at 23 in 2022, which is a drop of 13 r anks
since 2017. A figure exacerbating this issue is the number of y outh lacking health
insurance in the state. F ourteen percent of adults in Illinois reported living in
households with children who lack health insur ance as of 2022.   The need for interv ention services for y outh is mirror b y their families and
communities, and an integr al part of the communit y schools model is family and
communit y engagement. Adults in communities within the FSCS partner
schools/districts face risk factors similar to those faced b y their y outh, including
living in po verty, living without health insur ance, and insecure housing status. In
Illinois o verall, there is a po verty rate of 12%, almost matching the national
average of 13%. Y outh living in po verty elev ates their risk of experiencing
behavioral, social-emotional, and health challenges. Child po verty also reduces
skill-building opportunities and academic outcomes, including students’ capacit y to
learn and to gr aduate high school. In 2021, 16% of y outh in Illinois were reported
as living in po verty. 
The FSCS model w as created to respond to the factors outlined in preceding
paragraphs. It is a wholistic model of interv ention that focuses on addressing
external barriers to academic achiev ement that students and families face. The
purpose of this work, and this ev aluation study , is to understand how communit y
school services and progr amming work in combination with each other to boost
student preparedness and achiev ement. This study looks to build a body of
evidence that illustr ates the impact of communit y schools model on creating safe,
health y and supported en vironments where students and their adult caregiv ers are
engaged and achieving academically and promote the expansion of the communit y
schools model across the state of Illinois.","and Student/Staff Involvement

Background
The Museum of Science and Industry’ s Science Leadership Initiativ e (SLI) addresses
the critical issue of student achiev ement and exposure to STEM b y supporting science
education on a whole-school lev el. Its School P artners Progr am guides schools through
a process of gauging their current status in science education, creating an action plan,
and implementing that action plan o ver the course of 3 y ears. MSI supports its school
partners (which include a teacher leader , administr ator, and cross-disciplinary team of
multiple gr ade lev els from each school) to elev ate science progr amming at the whole-
school lev el. In past internal ev aluations of the SLI School P artners Progr am, progr am
participants r ated their experiences and the impact of SLI on their institution extremely
highly . Howev er, we ha ve no data on whether or not this impact is observ able at
institutions bey ond SLI’ s direct participants. This research study aims to measure
evidence of impact through the inclusion of a wide v ariety of administr ators and
instructional staff at SLI school partners, not just the individuals who ha ve direct
interaction with SLI progr amming. A similar study to this w as started, with IRB and CPS
RRB appro val, in the fall of 2019. Howev er, it was canceled in spring 2020 as a result of
the pandemic. This proposal describes a similar project, with a few modifications based
on our limited experience from that first attempt.
Literature Review
The purpose of this study is to measure whole-school change in the prioritization and
implementation of science education as a result of participating in the Science
Leadership Initiativ e  (SLI) School P artners Progr am at the Museum of Science and
Industry , Chicago . In past internal ev aluations of this progr am, participants r ated their
experiences and the impact of SLI on their institution highly . Howev er, the SLI School
Partners Progr am is designed to address the critical issue of student achiev ement and
exposure to STEM b y supporting science education on a whole-school lev el, and we
have no data to confirm the extent of this impact at SLI school partners bey ond the
progr am’s direct participants. Incorpor ating the perspectiv es of instructional staff and
administr ators that do not ha ve direct inter actions with SLI staff would pro vide a more
accur ate snapshot of how the tenets of the progr am are being disseminated and
implemented throughout the entire institution.
The SLI School P artners Progr am is founded on the idea that the creation of a whole-
school culture supporting science education is important for the initiation of whole-
school science education reform (Chiu, Price, & Ovr ahim, 2015). Although based in a
museum r ather than a school, SLI and other progr ams within the informal education
sector pla y a critical component in the o verall ecosystem of STEM education (NRC,
2009). Its model of guiding schools through the process of gauging their current status
in science education, creating an action plan with clearly defined goals and steps, and
implementing that action plan is based upon model path ways for successful STEM
integr ation (Bybee, 2013). Furthermore, its focus on not just science teachers, but
administr ators and cross-disciplinary teachers as well, is similarly based on best
practices in the field of STEM education. The National R esearch Council states that
“Effectiv e instruction activ ely engages students in science, mathematics, and
engineering pr actices throughout their school” (2011, p . 18). Additionally , evidence
suggests that school leaders – and in particular , principals – impro ve teaching and
learning through their influence on staff commitment, motiv ation, and work
environment (Leith wood, Harris, & Hopkins, 2008).
The design for this study is based on Coburn’ s (2003) fr amework for assessing the
concept of scale in school reform. Scale is comprised of four interrelated dimensions:depth, sustainabilit y, spread, and shift in reform ownership .
Depth: Changes in norms of social inter action, such as the w ay teachers and
students talk to each other about science and/or science education •
Sustainabilit y: A supportiv e professional communit y of colleagues at a school that
reinforce normativ e changes, knowledgeable and supportiv e school leadership ,
and connections with other schools or teachers engaged in similar reform
Spread: When the reform spreads to a greater number of classrooms, often
beyond areas of the classroom, times of da y, or activities dev oted to the targeted
subject
Shift in reform ownership: When authorit y and knowledge of the reform is
shifted to teachers and schools The surv ey instrument for this study incorpor ates
these dimensions to pro vide a more thorough understanding of the degree to
which SLI creates whole-school reform around science education.

Research Procedures Ov erview
The first surv ey was sent at the beginning of fall 2021 to pro vide baseline information
about the participating schools’ current perceptions and implementation of science
education. After opting in to the research study , a recruitment e-mail w as sent to each
school’ s teacher leader who is participating in the Science Leadership Initiativ e School
Partners Progr am and a supporting administr ation. This email contained a link to an
online surv ey that w as forw arded to all instructional staff . Identical surv eys will also be
sent at the end of each progr am year (3 additional times) to measure change o ver
time.
Study Timeline:
Survey 1: F all 2021 – Beginning of Progr am Year 1
Survey 2: Spring/Summer 2022 – End of Progr am Year 1
Survey 3: Spring/Summer 2023 – End of Progr am Year 2
Survey 4: Spring/Summer 2024 – End of Progr am Year 3
Survey Recruitment
All schools enrolled in their first y ear of the SLI School P artners Progr am beginning in
fall 2021 were in vited to participate. With each subsequent surv ey, instructional and
administr ative staff will be contacted to be a part of the study through the
administr ator that is participating in the SLI School P artners Progr am. The PI or
another member of the study personnel contacted administr ators in person during an
SLI work session at the Museum and/or reached out to them via email (See attached
example opt -in email template). Administr ators that agreed to participate will be
provided with an email template and a surv ey link to send out to their internal listserv
of administr ative and instructional staff . See the attached sample recruitment e-mail is
written from the v oice of MSI staff (as recommended to us in a reply to our prior RRB
submission in 2019).
To further encour age participation in the End of Y ear Surv ey, at the end of Y ear 2 we
began offering pizza to all staff at the participating schools. Schools were contacted b y
MSI professional learning staff and MSI offered to visit their school with pizza and
surveys. (See SLI 2023_Pizza recruitment email and sign-up genius). F or those schools
who opted-in, surv ey participation w as not a condition of enjo ying the pizza.
Additionally , to mak e participation as easy as possible, we also pro vided tablets with
the surv ey preloaded, QR codes for scanning on personal devices, and paper copies of
the surv ey.
Survey Consent
The first page of the online surv ey will contain a consent document and a ‘Y es/No’ click
box indicating whether or not they agree to participate in the study . Participants will
not be able to continue to the rest of the surv ey unless they select ‘Y es.’ If respondents
complete the surv ey multiple times throughout the study , they will go through the
consenting process each time they fill it out. See the attached surv ey consent form.
Survey Data Collection & Incentiv es
Each online and paper surv ey should tak e appro ximately 10-15 minutes to complete.
Each individual that completes a surv ey will be mailed an entry v oucher to the Museum
for 4 people. They will receiv e this entry v oucher each time they complete a surv ey
throughout the course of the study . Respondents will be sent v oucher -related
information to a personal email address of their choosing. Additionally , at each of the 4
data collection points, a r affle will be done within each school in which 1 respondent will
be randomly selected to receiv e a $50 Amaz on gift card. Also , any school that has
strong participation (appro ximately a third or more of instructional staff ) will be giv en
$250 paid directly to the school itself . Note that this latter incentiv e is to be directed
and paid out at the school-lev el and not to an individual staff member , as is the case
with other the incentiv es noted abo ve. The cohort of schools we intend to follow for thestudy period has been established, and school siz es (and thus the number of
instructional staff ) are v ariable. Using the amassed totals of instructional staff per
school, research personnel will be able to determine a good faith effort on the part of
schools to reach the abo ve outlined threshold. This a voids stating a specific number
that ma y not be feasible for a giv en school and a voids using a high percentage of
participation that ma y cause undue peer pressure for potential participants.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
Each time the surv ey is sent out, it will be sent out to the entire listserv of staff
associated with instruction and education (re: not just to the individuals who took the
first surv ey in fall 2021). Howev er, our hope is that individuals tak e the surv eys more
than once, and in such cases, it would be adv antageous from a statistical standpoint to
be able to link their responses. Furthermore, it will be essential to know which school
individuals are coming from, so that we can analyz e their responses as an aggregate
within their school site in order to measure institutional change o ver time. Therefore,
we will be collecting the following identif ying information (Note: some of this
information is not identif ying on its own, but could potentially be identif ying in
conjunction with other pieces of data collected in the surv ey – such as knowing the
school where someone works and also the courses/gr ades they teach).
-Name of school – Used for both analysis and to link responses o ver time
-First and last name – Used to link responses o ver time and for mailing out Museum
entry v ouchers as an incentiv e
-Email address – Optional, used only to send Museum entry v ouchers (All respondents
will first be pro vided with the option to ha ve vouchers sent to their school email , with
the option to pro vide an alternativ e address if they choose)
Personally identifiable information will be replaced with unique and anon ymous
identifiers during the processing of collected data. A crossw alk document will be k ept to
link identities and the UIDs until the final surv ey is collected. Once that final surv ey is
collected and processed, the crossw alk document will be destro yed.
All data will be stored digitally in two secure locations: (1) a password-protected
QuestionPro account (an online surv ey softw are progr am that will be utiliz ed to collect
the data) accessible only b y the Museum’ s Research and Ev aluation department, and
(2) on the Museum’ s secure network driv e, only regularly accessible b y members of the
Research and Ev aluation department, and in extremely r are cases, b y Museum IT staff .
No hard copies of data will be collected or stored. After data collection (i.e. after Y ear 3
of the progr am) and data analysis has been completed, first and last names of
respondents will be remo ved from the data sets. These de-identified digital data will be
kept on the Museum’ s network driv e indefinitely .
Reporting: All identifiers (e.g. names of schools, names of individuals, and emplo yment
titles) will be remo ved before data is shared or reported outside of the MSI R esearch
and Ev aluation department. This includes all preliminary reports, final reports, and/or
data sets shared with other Museum staff (such as SLI progr am staff ) or SLI progr am
participants.

minutes to complete.Please outline your protocol for observation activities, describing when, where,
duration, frequency, and with whom.
As part of the SLI School P artners Progr am, school cross-disciplinary teams consisting
of teachers from across different subjects and gr ade bands and administr ators meet
periodically throughout the school y ear. Occasionally MSI staff attend these meetings to
help facilitation and/or pro vide guidance to issues they are working on. In 2021-2022 it
is expected that the teams will be virtually (usually via Z oom or Google Meets) but it is
possible some ma y meet in-person or tak e a hybrid approach.
Starting in the 2021-22 school y ear, a member of the research personnel will attend
some of those meetings to tak e notes that ma y reflect progress or shed light on
challenges the teams are facing. The researcher would be a passiv e participant.
Sometimes they ma y be the only MSI staff there and sometimes they will be there
along with the regularly scheduling SLI staff member , who would then serv e in their
normal role.
Observ ations Timeline and Sampling
--------------------------
Year 1 (School Y ear 2021-2022): 2-3 observ ations of interdisciplinary team meetings
per school throughout the school y ear
Year 2 (School Y ear 2022-2023): 2-3 observ ations of interdisciplinary team meetings
per school throughout the school y ear
Year 3 (School Y ear 2023-2024): 2-3 observ ations of interdisciplinary team meetings
per school throughout the school y ear
Research Procedures
The researcher will tak e notes using an observ ation rubric attached to this application.
Most of the notes will be in the form of counting the number of times a specific subject
is brought up or action occurred. But direct quotations, without an y attribution, ma y
also be recorded in the rubric. No audio or video will be recorded in these sessions. The
only record will be via the observ ation rubric. In addition to the observ ation rubric, the
researcher will complete a short series of debrief questions following the observ ation.
Debrief questions will illuminate emergent trends, document which phase of work the
interdisciplinary team completed during the meeting, and reflect on meeting
conversation and content.
Our goal, for each school, is to observ e two sessions in fall 2021, one session in winter
2022 and one session in spring 2023. Howev er, it is possible that we will do fewer
based on a vailable staffing time.
Does this involve video, audio, or
photograph recording?
No 
Please note: Video/Audio classroom
observations where students are present
is not permitted unless every student
present for the observation has active
assent and parental consent. 
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
Printed observ ation rubrics with tallies and notes made b y the observ er will be entered
into an Ex cel database and then the paper copies will be destro yed. The database will
be kept on the Museum’ s secure network driv e, only regularly accessible b y members of
the R esearch and Ev aluation department, and in extremely r are cases, b y Museum IT
staff. These digital data will be k ept on the Museum’ s network driv e indefinitely .
How will you protect individuals who did not consent to participate in the
observation, and what will non-consented students be doing during the
observation(s)? 
At the start of each meeting a v erbal consent script will be read (see attached script).Anyone who does not w ant to be included in the rubric will be giv en the option to opt
out. In those cases, their participation will not be included in the rubric (no quotes will
be tak en and they will not be included in an y counts). The total number of people in a
session who opt out of being included will be noted, so the researchers can consider
that in their later analysis. But the identities of the specific people who opt out will not
be recorded. If the meeting is virtual, the observ er will instruct an yone w anting to opt -
out to send them a priv ate message via the chat feature. If the meeting is in person,
then blank note cards will be handed to all attendees. Ev eryone will be ask ed to write
their name on the note card. If an yone w ants to opt out, they will be ask ed to indicate
that that as well. Then all note cards will be passed to the observ er. Participants will
have nametags on the tables in front of them, so the observ er can use that to know
who to lea ve out of the notes. Observ ations will only be made of the cross-disciplinary
school team members who consent, no additional staff or students will be observ ed.

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the
motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The Museum of Science and Industry , Chicago has a progr am called the Science
Leadership Initiativ e. Each y ear, about 15 schools join the 3- year progr am. During that
time, MSI tr ains teacher leaders to support the science at the whole school lev el. That
is, to enhance science learning across the school (not just in science classes). This
study is a proposal to learn more about the progr am's impact at the whole school lev el
as each y ear progresses. W e request to send surv eys to all teachers and educational
staff at a school. W e also request to observ e and tak e notes at some team meetings
that happen at the school (or virtually). These meetings in volve a cross disciplinary
team of teachers and administr ators across the school and are facilitated b y a teacher
leader tr ained b y MSI as part of this progr am. W e propose to do this for each of the 3
years the school is in the progr am for the cohort of schools entering into the progr am
during the 2021-22 school y ear. 
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
In past internal ev aluations of the SLI School P artners Progr am, progr am participants
rated their experiences and the impact of SLI on their institution extremely highly .
Howev er, we ha ve no data on whether or not this impact is observ able at institutions
beyond SLI’ s direct participants. This research study aims to measure evidence of
impact through the inclusion of a wide v ariety of administr ators and instructional staff
at SLI school partners, not just the individuals who ha ve direct inter action with SLI
progr amming.  
Research Question: What is the whole-school impact on science education as a result of
participating in the SLI School P artners Progr am? Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What
is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the
body of extant knowledge?
Background
The Museum of Science and Industry’ s Science Leadership Initiativ e (SLI) addresses
the critical issue of student achiev ement and exposure to STEM b y supporting science
education on a whole-school lev el. Its School P artners Progr am guides schools through
a process of gauging their current status in science education, creating an action plan,
and implementing that action plan o ver the course of 3 y ears. MSI supports its school
partners (which include a teacher leader , administr ator, and cross-disciplinary team of
multiple gr ade lev els from each school) to elev ate science progr amming at the whole-
school lev el. In past internal ev aluations of the SLI School P artners Progr am, progr am
participants r ated their experiences and the impact of SLI on their institution extremely
highly . Howev er, we ha ve no data on whether or not this impact is observ able at
institutions bey ond SLI’ s direct participants. This research study aims to measure
evidence of impact through the inclusion of a wide v ariety of administr ators and
instructional staff at SLI school partners, not just the individuals who ha ve direct
interaction with SLI progr amming. A similar study to this w as started, with IRB and CPS
RRB appro val, in the fall of 2019. Howev er, it was canceled in spring 2020 as a result of
the pandemic. This proposal describes a similar project, with a few modifications based
on our limited experience from that first attempt.
Literature Review
The purpose of this study is to measure whole-school change in the prioritization and
implementation of science education as a result of participating in the Science
Leadership Initiativ e  (SLI) School P artners Progr am at the Museum of Science and
Industry , Chicago . In past internal ev aluations of this progr am, participants r ated their
experiences and the impact of SLI on their institution highly . Howev er, the SLI School
Partners Progr am is designed to address the critical issue of student achiev ement and
exposure to STEM b y supporting science education on a whole-school lev el, and we
have no data to confirm the extent of this impact at SLI school partners bey ond the
progr am’s direct participants. Incorpor ating the perspectiv es of instructional staff and
administr ators that do not ha ve direct inter actions with SLI staff would pro vide a more
accur ate snapshot of how the tenets of the progr am are being disseminated and
implemented throughout the entire institution.
The SLI School P artners Progr am is founded on the idea that the creation of a whole-
school culture supporting science education is important for the initiation of whole-
school science education reform (Chiu, Price, & Ovr ahim, 2015). Although based in a
museum r ather than a school, SLI and other progr ams within the informal education
sector pla y a critical component in the o verall ecosystem of STEM education (NRC,
2009). Its model of guiding schools through the process of gauging their current status
in science education, creating an action plan with clearly defined goals and steps, and
implementing that action plan is based upon model path ways for successful STEM
integr ation (Bybee, 2013). Furthermore, its focus on not just science teachers, but
administr ators and cross-disciplinary teachers as well, is similarly based on best
practices in the field of STEM education. The National R esearch Council states that
“Effectiv e instruction activ ely engages students in science, mathematics, and
engineering pr actices throughout their school” (2011, p . 18). Additionally , evidence
suggests that school leaders – and in particular , principals – impro ve teaching and
learning through their influence on staff commitment, motiv ation, and work
environment (Leith wood, Harris, & Hopkins, 2008).
The design for this study is based on Coburn’ s (2003) fr amework for assessing the
concept of scale in school reform. Scale is comprised of four interrelated dimensions:depth, sustainabilit y, spread, and shift in reform ownership .
Depth: Changes in norms of social inter action, such as the w ay teachers and
students talk to each other about science and/or science education •
Sustainabilit y: A supportiv e professional communit y of colleagues at a school that
reinforce normativ e changes, knowledgeable and supportiv e school leadership ,
and connections with other schools or teachers engaged in similar reform
Spread: When the reform spreads to a greater number of classrooms, often
beyond areas of the classroom, times of da y, or activities dev oted to the targeted
subject
Shift in reform ownership: When authorit y and knowledge of the reform is
shifted to teachers and schools The surv ey instrument for this study incorpor ates
these dimensions to pro vide a more thorough understanding of the degree to
which SLI creates whole-school reform around science education.

Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated
with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will
be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
There are two main measurements: surv eys and observ ation rubrics:
1. Surveys
All schools currently enrolled in their first y ear of the SLI School P artners Progr am
beginning in fall 2021 will be in vited to participate. Instructional and administr ative
staff will be contacted to be a part of the study through the administr ator that is
participating in the SLI School P artners Progr am. The PI or another member of the
study personnel will contact administr ators in person during an SLI work session at the
Museum and/or reach out to them via email. Administr ators that agree to participate
will be pro vided with an email template and a surv ey link to send out to their internal
listserv of administr ative and instructional staff . Each time the surv ey is sent out, it will
be sent out to the entire listserv of staff associated with instruction and education. MSI
staff will also contact administr ators/lead teachers to offer an in-person surv ey data
collection option. During in-person data collection, MSI research staff will pro vide
tablets, QR codes, and paper copies of the surv ey along with pizza. Staff ma y enjo y
pizza regardless of their participation in the surv ey. Surv eys will tak e appro ximately
10-15 to complete. 
2. Observation Rubric
As part of the SLI progr am, school cross-disciplinary teams meet periodically
throughout the school y ear. Occasionally MSI staff attend these meetings to help
facilitation and/or pro vide guidance to issues they are working on. In 2021-2022 it is
expected that the teams will be virtually (usually via Z oom or Google Meet) but it is
possible some ma y meet in-person or tak e a hybrid approach. During the research
study , a member of the research personnel will attend some of those meetings to tak e
notes that ma y reflect progress or shed light on challenges the teams are facing. The
researcher would be a passiv e participant.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
The object of this study is to measure whole-school change in the prioritization and
implementation of science education as a result of participating in the SLI School
Partners Progr am.  Quantitativ e measures include a surv ey about changes in science
instructional minutes, planning time dedicated to science education efforts, staff
perceptions of science education at their school, and the t ypes of science initiativ es that
are being implemented. The surv ey data will be collected at the beginning of Y ear 1 of
the SLI School P artners Progr am (F all of 2021) with schools entering into the progr am
in the 2021-22 school y ear. Surv eys will be repeated at the end of each school y ear for
the three- year dur ation of the progr am. Qualitativ e measures include an observ ation
rubric that will be filled out b y researchers passiv ely observing group meetings of each
school’ s cross-disciplinary team.  As a measure of change across time, analysis is lik ely
to include independent and paired samples (should a robust enough sample of link ed
surveys be garnered) comparisons of means and distributions across each of the four
survey data sets. Giv en the bespok e nature of actions plans dev eloped as part of the
SLI School P artners Progr am, explor atory analysis across time within schools ma y may
also be conducted. Explor ation of associations and relationships amongst quantitativ e
survey items ma y also tak e place to further illuminate trends and patterns in change
across time. Analysis of observ ational data will lik ely include frequency counts and
narrative summaries that will be used to illuminate findings and trends of the
quantitativ e surv ey measures."

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The Y outh Risk Beha vior Surv ey (YRBS), sponsored b y the CDC Division of
Adolescent and School Health, monitors priorit y health risk beha viors that
contribute to the leading causes of mortalit y, morbidit y, and social problems
among y outh and y oung adults in the U .S., including: 1) beha viors that
contribute to unintentional injury and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol
and other drug use; 4) sexual beha viors that contribute to unintended
pregnancy and sexually tr ansmitted diseases, including HIV infection; 5)
dietary beha viors; and 6) ph ysical inactivit y. Conducted biennially among
U.S. 6th-12th gr aders attending public and priv ate schools, the national
YRBS allows CDC to assess how risk beha viors change o ver time among the
high school population. Local YRBS administr ation pro vides data that is
nationally compar able to other school districts.
Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has participated in the High School YRBS since
1991, and the Middle School YRBS since 2007 . F or 21 of the largest school
districts and all 50 states across the country , the YRBS is a quintessential
tool for gathering information on y outh risk beha viors. The CPS Office of
Student Health and W ellness (OSHW), which aims to remo ve health-related
barriers to learning so students ma y succeed in college, career and life,
administers the local surv ey and uses the results of YRBS to inform
progr ams and policies for the District and the Cit y of Chicago .
Middle schools and high schools are r andomly selected to participate in the
survey. Classes within the participant schools are r andomly selected to
receiv e the surv ey. The surv ey is self -administered and web-based (using
Qualtrics). It tak es one class period (appro ximately 45 minutes) to
complete. All surv ey materials are included in this application pack et.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Research Question:
What is the prev alence of specific priorit y risk beha viors among Chicago
Public School 6th - 12th gr ade students? The priorit y risk beha viors fall into
six categories: 1) beha viors that contribute to unintentional injuries and
violence; 2) sexual beha viors that contribute to human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) infection, other sexually tr ansmitted diseases, and unintended
pregnancy; 3) tobacco use; 4) alcohol and other drug use; 5) unhealth y
dietary beha viors; and 6) ph ysical inactivit y. 
Hypothesis:
The YRBS is a part of ongoing surv eillance of students that gathers
nationally representativ e data on sev eral priorit y health risk beha viors.
Therefore, there are no specific h ypotheses addressed b y this research. The
objectiv es of the surv ey are to measure the current prev alence of health risk
behaviors and attitudes and to measure trends in these beha viors and
attitudes o ver time.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Research Purpose
The purpose of administering the YRBS to Chicago Public Schools (CPS)
students is to gather nationally compar able local data on priorit y health risk
behaviors that can 1) describe the prev alence of priorit y health-risk
behaviors among Chicago Public School students, 2) assess trends in health-
risk beha viors o ver time, and 3) ev aluate and impro ve health related CPS
policies and progr ams. 
The Office of Student Health and W ellness will use this information to
educate the school communit y, influence health and wellness-related school
policies, prioritiz e health progr aming, compare school district data to other
large urban school districts, and ha ve data a vailable for analysis, gr ant
writing, policymaking, and progr am dev elopment b y sharing datasets to
external partners, researchers, students and the public health communit y. 
Literature R eview
Data from surv eillance systems are critical for planning and ev aluating public
health progr ams. Health-risk beha viors contribute to the leading causes of
morbidit y and mortalit y among y outh in the United States.1 The Y outh Risk
Behavior Surv ey (YRBS), which is a part of the Y outh Risk Beha vior
Surveillance S ystem (YRBS S), w as dev eloped in 1991 b y the feder al Centers
for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) to monitor health beha viors that
contribute mark edly to the leading causes of death, disabilit y, and social
problems among y outh and adults in the United States. The YRBS enables
public health professionals, educators, policy mak ers, and researchers to 1)
describe the prev alence of health-risk beha viors among y ouths, 2) assess
trends in health-risk beha viors o ver time, and 3) ev aluate and impro ve
health related policies and progr ams. This surv eillance system w as also
developed to pro vide compar able national, state, territorial, and large urban
school district data as well as compar able data among subpopulations of
youths (e.g. , racial/ethnic subgroups) to monitor progress tow ard achieving
national health objectiv es and other progr am indicators. Local school-based
surveys of representativ e samples of 9th through 12th gr ade students are
conducted ev ery two y ears.1,2 
YRBS data are used widely to compare the prev alence of health-related
behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health-related
behaviors o ver time; monitor progress tow ard achieving 21 national health
objectiv es; pro vide compar able state and large urban school district data;
and tak e public health actions to decrease health-risk beha viors and impro ve
health outcomes among y outh. Using this and other reports based on
scientifically sound data is important for r aising a wareness about the
prevalence of health-related beha viors among students in gr ades 9–12,
especially sexual minorit y students, among decision mak ers, the public, and
a wide v ariety of agencies and organizations that work with y outh.3 References:

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The Y outh Risk Beha vior Surv ey (YRBS), sponsored b y the CDC Division of
Adolescent and School Health, monitors priorit y health risk beha viors that
contribute to the leading causes of mortalit y, morbidit y, and social problems
among y outh and y oung adults in the U .S., including: 1) beha viors that
contribute to unintentional injury and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol
and other drug use; 4) sexual beha viors that contribute to unintended
pregnancy and sexually tr ansmitted diseases, including HIV infection; 5)
dietary beha viors; and 6) ph ysical inactivit y. Conducted biennially among
U.S. 6th-12th gr aders attending public and priv ate schools, the national
YRBS allows CDC to assess how risk beha viors change o ver time among the
high school population. Local YRBS administr ation pro vides data that is
nationally compar able to other school districts.
Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has participated in the High School YRBS since
1991, and the Middle School YRBS since 2007 . F or 21 of the largest school
districts and all 50 states across the country , the YRBS is a quintessential
tool for gathering information on y outh risk beha viors. The CPS Office of
Student Health and W ellness (OSHW), which aims to remo ve health-related
barriers to learning so students ma y succeed in college, career and life,
administers the local surv ey and uses the results of YRBS to inform
progr ams and policies for the District and the Cit y of Chicago .
Middle schools and high schools are r andomly selected to participate in the
survey. Classes within the participant schools are r andomly selected to
receiv e the surv ey. The surv ey is self -administered and web-based (using
Qualtrics). It tak es one class period (appro ximately 45 minutes) to
complete. All surv ey materials are included in this application pack et. 
 Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Research Question:
What is the prev alence of specific priorit y risk beha viors among Chicago
Public School 6th - 12th gr ade students? The priorit y risk beha viors fall into
six categories: 1) beha viors that contribute to unintentional injuries and
violence; 2) sexual beha viors that contribute to human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) infection, other sexually tr ansmitted diseases, and unintended
pregnancy; 3) tobacco use; 4) alcohol and other drug use; 5) unhealth y
dietary beha viors; and 6) ph ysical inactivit y. 
Hypothesis:
The YRBS is a part of ongoing surv eillance of students that gathers
nationally representativ e data on sev eral priorit y health risk beha viors.
Therefore, there are no specific h ypotheses addressed b y this research. The
objectiv es of the surv ey are to measure the current prev alence of health risk
behaviors and attitudes and to measure trends in these beha viors and
attitudes o ver time. 
 Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Research Purpose
The purpose of administering the YRBS to Chicago Public Schools (CPS)
students is to gather nationally compar able local data on priorit y health risk
behaviors that can 1) describe the prev alence of priorit y health-risk
behaviors among Chicago Public School students, 2) assess trends in health-
risk beha viors o ver time, and 3) ev aluate and impro ve health related CPS
policies and progr ams. 
The Office of Student Health and W ellness will use this information to
educate the school communit y, influence health and wellness-related school
policies, prioritiz e health progr aming, compare school district data to other
large urban school districts, and ha ve data a vailable for analysis, gr ant
writing, policymaking, and progr am dev elopment b y sharing datasets to
external partners, researchers, students and the public health communit y. 
Literature R eview
Data from surv eillance systems are critical for planning and ev aluating public
health progr ams. Health-risk beha viors contribute to the leading causes of
morbidit y and mortalit y among y outh in the United States.1 The Y outh Risk
Behavior Surv ey (YRBS), which is a part of the Y outh Risk Beha vior
Surveillance S ystem (YRBS S), w as dev eloped in 1991 b y the feder al Centers
for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) to monitor health beha viors that
contribute mark edly to the leading causes of death, disabilit y, and social
problems among y outh and adults in the United States. The YRBS enables
public health professionals, educators, policy mak ers, and researchers to 1)
describe the prev alence of health-risk beha viors among y ouths, 2) assess
trends in health-risk beha viors o ver time, and 3) ev aluate and impro ve
health related policies and progr ams. This surv eillance system w as also
developed to pro vide compar able national, state, territorial, and large urban
school district data as well as compar able data among subpopulations of
youths (e.g. , racial/ethnic subgroups) to monitor progress tow ard achieving
national health objectiv es and other progr am indicators. Local school-based
surveys of representativ e samples of 9th through 12th gr ade students are
conducted ev ery two y ears.1,2 
YRBS data are used widely to compare the prev alence of health-related
behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health-related
behaviors o ver time; monitor progress tow ard achieving 21 national health
objectiv es; pro vide compar able state and large urban school district data;
and tak e public health actions to decrease health-risk beha viors and impro ve
health outcomes among y outh. Using this and other reports based on
scientifically sound data is important for r aising a wareness about the
prevalence of health-related beha viors among students in gr ades 9–12,
especially sexual minorit y students, among decision mak ers, the public, and
a wide v ariety of agencies and organizations that work with y outh.3 References:

 Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
Following district research appro val, the study coordinators will work with
each school principal or a designee to confirm the school's participation,
select one mutually con venient surv ey date, and r andomly select
participating classes following CDC protocol. One staff member at each
school is needed to pro vide class schedule information to the surv ey logistics
coordinator for the r andom selection of intact classrooms. This staff member
also will be ask ed to distribute passiv e consent parental permission form
packets to teachers of selected classes, confirm with teachers the
distribution of passiv e consent parental permission forms to students prior to
the surv ey, and complete the School Enrollment F orm. All of these forms will
be pro vided to the staff for distribution. W e expect these activities to tak e
appro ximately 25 minutes.
Teachers of selected classes are ask ed to follow a short permission form
distribution script and distribute passiv e consent parental permission forms
to students in selected classes. Historically , CPS has allowed passiv e
parental permission for the YRBS in order to increase response r ates
necessary to obtain nationally compar able weighted data. W e expect these
activities to tak e appro ximately 15 minutes.
A trained data collector (either the outreach coordinator or the classroom
teacher) will administer the YRBS to eligible students in the selected classes
at each school on one mutually con venient date between January and July
2025. A script will be pro vided for distributing the parental consent forms
and administering the surv ey. Students will be ask ed to complete an
anonymous and confidential web-based surv ey in Qualtrics or paper -and-
pencil questionnaire that tak es appro ximately 45 minutes. This includes time
for the data collector to introduce the surv ey to the class, obtain student
assent, distribute surv ey materials, and o versee surv ey completion b y
eligible students. Students will also be giv en a handout that pro vides helpful
resources relev ant to some of the more sensitiv e topics co vered b y the
YRBS .  
Participation in the YRBS b y schools and students is v oluntary . As an
incentiv e for participation, high schools and middle schools receiv ed $500 for
successful administr ation of the surv ey.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
We receiv ed the 2025 standard questionnaire and optional question list,
which we modified to better reflect Chicago y outh. W e also receiv ed a
sample of middle and high schools from the Centers of Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) that were selected to participate in the 2025 YRBS . In
total, 104 schools were r andomly selected to participate. Principals were
contacted in September b y surv eillance coordinators via email about their
random selection to participate and were ask ed to respond with a school
staff member that would be their school’ s YRBS coordinator . The school’ s
YRBS coordinator pro vided the surv eillance team with a class list of either a
specific period of the da y or required course. Classrooms were numbered b y
the surv eillance coordinator and selected based on numbers pro vided b y the
CDC for each school. After classrooms were selected, schools were mailed a
packet of administr ation materials including the student support handout,
classroom-lev el sample forms, script for surv ey administr ators,
confidentialit y agreements, and da y-of administr ation guides. If the class
was taking the web-based surv ey, they were also mailed unique passcodes
for each class. If the class w as taking the paper -and-pencil surv ey, they
were mailed paper surv eys, scantrons, and #2 pencils for each classroom.
After the surv ey was administered, the YRBS coordinator or classroom
teacher filled out classroom-lev el sample forms outlining the number of
students who took the surv ey, how man y students are attending class in
person, how man y are attending class virtually , and how man y students
refused to tak e the surv ey or were absent. Once administr ation w as
completed b y all schools, classroom-lev el sample forms, data files from web-
based surv eys, and paper surv ey scantrons were mailed with tr acking to
Westat. W estat processes the data and we receiv e the S AS files,
demogr aphic and summary tables, trend reports, and demogr aphic reports.
Once we receiv e the S AS files, we will analyz e the data in S AS to create a
2025 YRBS databook. W e will analyz e health beha viors based on v arious
demogr aphic char acteristics of students."

is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the
body of extant knowledge?
Refugee and immigr ant children ma y experience high lev els of stress and tr auma
before, during, and after migr ation, resulting in significant mental health disparities
(Perreir a & Ornelas, 2013; Smok owski et al. , 2007; T orres et al. , 2018). F or example,
research suggests that refugees who ha ve resettled in W estern countries are 10 times
more lik ely to dev elop posttr aumatic stress disorder (PT SD) compared to non-
immigr ant/non-refugee groups (F azel et al. , 2005). Among both refugee and immigr ant
children, reports of tr auma exposure are high and significantly predict symptoms of
PTSD and depression (Betancourt et al. , 2017; de Arellano et al. , 2018). After arriv al in
new host countries, y outh are faced with additional stressors including po verty,
discrimination, and adjustment to an unfamiliar en vironment (Montgomery & F oldspang,
2007; Simich et al. , 2006). These stressors further elev ate risk for mental health
difficulties including anxiet y, depression, and beha vioral problems (Betancourt et. al,
2012). Not only are y outh faced with these stressors, but refugee and immigr ant
families also experience inequit y in access to mental health support (Derr , 2015).
Barriers such as lack of health insur ance, cultur ally appropriate services, costs, fear , and
stigma impact refugee and immigr ant service access (AP A Presidential T ask Force on
Immigr ation, 2012; Derr , 2015).
Given these inequities, it is critical to pro vide mental health interv entions that are
contextualiz ed to meet the needs of refugee and immigr ant youth in accessible  settings
that reduce barriers. Integr ating services into schools reduces logistical barriers and
provides services in a less stigmatizing en vironment. Further , interv entions designed to
foster resilience, strengthen adaptiv e coping, and promote connection, ha ve the
potential to reduce mental health disparities among refugee and immigr ant youth (F azel
et al., 2012). The Supporting T ransition R esilience Of Newcomer Groups (STRONG;
Hoover et al. , 2019) progr am w as dev eloped to support mental health among newcomer
refugee and immigr ant students b y (1) promoting positiv e adjustment during
resettlement through a tr auma-informed, strengths-based approach, contextualiz ed to
meet the needs of refugee and immigr ant youth; and (2) impro ving access to services
through school-based  progr amming. Although contextualiz ed to support y outh during
resettlement, STRONG w as designed to support y outh across div erse refugee and
immigr ant groups with broad inclusion criteria. 
The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiv eness of STRONG on the mental
health of refugee and immigr ant students using a group r andomiz ed waitlist control
design (e.g. , randomization b y school/group). Further , the impact of STRONG on k ey
target mechanisms (e.g. , resilience, coping, and school connectedness) are also
examined. Finally , we examine the implementation of STRONG to guide additional
dissemination. School-based mental health clinicians will co-facilitate STRONG groups in
schools, meeting once a week. STRONG will be implemented in six public schools across
two academic y ears. In each school, one group of appro ximately fiv e students will be
implemented, resulting in a sample of 60 students total across the two y ears. Schools
will be r andomly assigned to either pro vide the STRONG progr am immediately
(immediate treatment) or after three months (dela yed treatment). A team of 10
undergr aduate students and four gr aduate students will collect data at baseline and at
three- and six -months post baseline.","to Date
Across both y ears of the study (2021-2022, 2022-2023), we enrolled a total of 64
students into the STRONG research study . We also conducted 2 focus groups with
facilitators of STRONG and teacher interviews. No additional data will be collected. Data

The Supporting T ransition R esilience Of Newcomer Groups (STRONG; Hoo ver, 2018)
progr am w as dev eloped to support newcomer refugee/immigr ant students b y (1)
promoting positiv e adjustment during resettlement through a tr auma-informed,
strengths-based approach and (2) impro ving access to mental health supports through
school-based progr amming. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibilit y,
acceptabilit y, and impact of STRONG to inform modifications and future dissemination of
the progr am within and bey ond CPS .
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Aim 1: Evaluate impact of STRONG on student mental health via randomized
waitlist control design.
1. We hypothesiz e that students who participate in STRONG will show
impro vements in self -reported, parent -reported, and teacher -reported mental
health (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, h yperactivit y/inattention, and
peer problems) as compared to the w aitlist control group (primary outcome). 
Aim 2: Examine the impact of STRONG on resilience, coping, and school
connectedness and how these changes are related to student mental health
outcomes.
1. We hypothesiz e that students who participate in STRONG will show
impro vements in self -reported resilience, coping efficacy , school connectedness,
and parent -reported coping as compared to the w aitlist control group (target
mechanisms).
2. We hypothesiz e that these changes will be related to student mental health
impro vement/maintenance o ver time (mechanism of action). 
Aim 3: Examine implementation of STRONG across schools.
1. We will conduct focus groups with clinicians and interviews with school
personnel (teachers, administr ators) to examine the challenges and successes
related to implementation of STRONG. Qualitativ e thematic analysis will be
conducted.
2. Satisfaction (clinician, parent, and student), student engagement with each
session, and fidelit y ratings will be examined.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What
is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the
body of extant knowledge?
Refugee and immigr ant children ma y experience high lev els of stress and tr auma
before, during, and after migr ation, resulting in significant mental health disparities
(Perreir a & Ornelas, 2013; Smok owski et al. , 2007; T orres et al. , 2018). F or example,
research suggests that refugees who ha ve resettled in W estern countries are 10 times
more lik ely to dev elop posttr aumatic stress disorder (PT SD) compared to non-
immigr ant/non-refugee groups (F azel et al. , 2005). Among both refugee and immigr ant
children, reports of tr auma exposure are high and significantly predict symptoms of
PTSD and depression (Betancourt et al. , 2017; de Arellano et al. , 2018). After arriv al in
new host countries, y outh are faced with additional stressors including po verty,
discrimination, and adjustment to an unfamiliar en vironment (Montgomery & F oldspang,
2007; Simich et al. , 2006). These stressors further elev ate risk for mental health
difficulties including anxiet y, depression, and beha vioral problems (Betancourt et. al,
2012). Not only are y outh faced with these stressors, but refugee and immigr ant
families also experience inequit y in access to mental health support (Derr , 2015).
Barriers such as lack of health insur ance, cultur ally appropriate services, costs, fear , and
stigma impact refugee and immigr ant service access (AP A Presidential T ask Force on
Immigr ation, 2012; Derr , 2015).
Given these inequities, it is critical to pro vide mental health interv entions that are
contextualiz ed to meet the needs of refugee and immigr ant youth in accessible  settings
that reduce barriers. Integr ating services into schools reduces logistical barriers and
provides services in a less stigmatizing en vironment. Further , interv entions designed to
foster resilience, strengthen adaptiv e coping, and promote connection, ha ve the
potential to reduce mental health disparities among refugee and immigr ant youth (F azel
et al., 2012). The Supporting T ransition R esilience Of Newcomer Groups (STRONG;
Hoover et al. , 2019) progr am w as dev eloped to support mental health among newcomer
refugee and immigr ant students b y (1) promoting positiv e adjustment during
resettlement through a tr auma-informed, strengths-based approach, contextualiz ed to
meet the needs of refugee and immigr ant youth; and (2) impro ving access to services
through school-based  progr amming. Although contextualiz ed to support y outh during
resettlement, STRONG w as designed to support y outh across div erse refugee and
immigr ant groups with broad inclusion criteria. 
The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiv eness of STRONG on the mental
health of refugee and immigr ant students using a group r andomiz ed waitlist control
design (e.g. , randomization b y school/group). Further , the impact of STRONG on k ey
target mechanisms (e.g. , resilience, coping, and school connectedness) are also
examined. Finally , we examine the implementation of STRONG to guide additional
dissemination. School-based mental health clinicians will co-facilitate STRONG groups in
schools, meeting once a week. STRONG will be implemented in six public schools across
two academic y ears. In each school, one group of appro ximately fiv e students will be
implemented, resulting in a sample of 60 students total across the two y ears. Schools
will be r andomly assigned to either pro vide the STRONG progr am immediately
(immediate treatment) or after three months (dela yed treatment). A team of 10
undergr aduate students and four gr aduate students will collect data at baseline and at
three- and six -months post baseline. Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated
with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will
be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
The activ e data collection the research team will conduct is for qualitativ e and
quantitativ e data regarding progr am implementation. Surv eys will be collected from
students and parents regarding student functioning, resilience, school connectedness
and satisfaction. F acilitators will be in vited to participate in a focus group and teachers
will be in vited to participate in an interview (one teacher per STRONG school). Note,
during the pilot y ear, qualitativ e interviews were conducted with students and parents
(appro ved by RRB), but this will not continue in the current protocol.
Qualitativ e Data: F ocus groups will be conducted with facilitators of STRONG
(appro ximately 1 hour in length). T eachers will complete k ey informant interviews
(appro ximately 30 minutes in length). F ocus groups/interviews will be conducted to
examine their positiv e and negativ e experiences with implementation and
recommendations for future implementation. F ocus groups/interviews will be audio-
recorded and then tr anscribed. T ranscripts will then be imported into Dedoose, a
qualitativ e softw are progr am designed to facilitate thematic coding. Codes will be
gener ated using an integr ated approach: codes will be determined b y both participant
responses and predetermined codes based on past liter ature (Br adley et al. , 2007).
Trained research assistants will code tr anscripts, which will then be clarified and revised
as necessary b y the research team and broad themes will be identified.
Quantitativ e Data: Quantitativ e data will be collected b y the ev aluation team as part of
the STRONG progr am implementation. P arents and students would be in vited to
complete the surv eys 3 times appro ximately 3 months apart.
Parent Quantitativ e Data: Quantitativ e data collected b y the research team across three
timepoints. P arents complete the R esponses to Stress Questionnaire (RSQ; Connor -
Smith, Compas, W adsworth, Harding Thomsen, & Saltzman, 2000) to assess student
coping and responses to stress. P arents will also complete the Coping Efficacy measure
(Sandler , Tein, Mehta, W olchik, & A yers, 2000), which will assess parents' beliefs of
their children's abilities to handle difficult situations.  P er NIMH, parents who speak
English or Spanish will also complete the RCADS-25. In addition, parents will complete
a demogr aphic form (baseline) and a satisfaction form (post -interv ention). After
informed consent is obtained, baseline questionnaires will be giv en to the parent to read
in a quiet room, alone with research staff at the school.  F ollow up surv eys can be
completed b y phone. All data will be de-identified through use of assigned identification
numbers. P arent questionnaires will tak e appro ximately 20 minutes at each time point.
Student Quantitativ e Data: Additionally , students who are 11 y ears or older will
complete the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997) to assess
student functioning, the School Connectedness Scale (Furlong et. al, 2011) to assess
feelings tow ard school, the California Health y Kids Surv ey (CHKS; W estEd, 2000) to
assess student well-being, support systems, engagement and school climate,the
Connor -Davidson R esilience Scale (CD-RISC; Connor & Da vidson, 2003) to assess
student resiliency , and the Coping Efficacy measure (Sandler , Tein, Mehta, W olchik, &
Ayers, 2000), to assess students' beliefs about their abilities to handle difficult
situations, ethnic identit y (MEIM; Phinney 1992), and the RCADS-25. R eseach team
staff will administer surv eys reading each item along with the child as they circle their
responses. When the form is stored b y research staff , data will only be recorded with
the study ID number . At the end of the interv ention, students will r ate their satisfaction
with the STRONG progr am and skills attained throughout the interv ention, in addition to
the measures described abo ve. Student questionnaires will tak e appro ximately 30
minutes to complete.
As is standard pr actice when students are eligible for a group interv ention within CPS ,
teachers will complete the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman,1997) to assess student functioning before and after the interv ention. T eachers
complete these measures within the school and giv e them to clinicians who are
conducting the group interv ention. Copies of the teacher SDQs will be shared with the
research team. It is estimated that each SDQ will tak e appro ximately 5 minutes to
complete.
Clinician Quantitativ e Data: Clinicians will r ate fidelit y for each interv ention session and
rate students’ engagement with sessions, o verall functioning, and whether students had
completed homework for the sessions. Finally , clinicians will r ate their satisfaction with
STRONG at the end of the interv ention. Clinician surv eys will be a vailable in
paper/pencil format or via online surv ey platform (e.g. , Qualtrics) depending on
preferences. It is estimated that it will tak e appro ximately 10 minutes to complete
session forms each session.
All procedures were previously appro ved by the RRB and ha ve also been appro ved by
Loyola IRB and Lurie IRB .","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
Quantitativ e and qualitativ e methods will be utiliz ed at v arious stages of the study .
Intent to treat analyses will be conducted, and imputation approaches will be
considered. Pre- treatment group differences will be included as co variates in analyses,
as appropriate. Outliers and assumptions of normalit y will be examined and
transformations considered.
Aim 1. To test the h ypotheses that  students who participate in STRONG will show
impro vements in self -reported, parent -reported, and teacher -reported mental health
(emotional symptoms, conduct problems, h yperactivit y/inattention, and peer problems)
as compared to the w aitlist control group , repeated measures Analyses of V ariance
(ANOV A) will be conducted ( Aim 1, Hypothesis 1 ). Repeated measures ANOV As will be
conducted on the primary mental health v ariables (total difficulties, emotional
symptoms, conduct problems, h yperactivit y/inattention, and peer problems) from
baseline to post -treatment to test for a significant Time X Group inter action. P ower
analyses conducted with GP ower (F aul et al. , 2006) indicate that a sample siz e of N=54
is required to detect a Time X Group inter action with a medium effect using two time-
points and N=44 utilizing all three repeated measures, suggesting adequate power . 
Aim 2. To test the h ypotheses that students who participate in STRONG will show
impro vements in self -reported resilience, coping efficacy , school connectedness and
parent -reported coping ( Aim 2, Hypothesis 1 ), repeated measures ANOV As will be
conducted on resilience, coping, and school connection  from baseline to post -treatment
to test for a significant Time X Group inter action. T o test the h ypothesis that
these changes will be related to student mental health impro vement/maintenance o ver
time ( Aim 2, Hypothesis 2 ), hier archical linear modeling (HLM) will be utiliz ed. HLM
analyses (repeated measures nested within individuals) will allow for an examination of
how changes o ver time on interv ention targets (resilience, coping, and school
connection) predict student mental health tr ajectories across all three time-points for
the immediate treatment group . This approach is ideal for nested data and capitaliz es
on all existing time points. 
Aim 3. To examine implementation of STRONG, qualitativ e methods will be
emplo yed. Focus group and interview scripts will be dev eloped to assess
implementation challenges and successes, as well as how the interv ention fit within the
school/communit y context and across differing newcomer path ways (e.g. , refugee vs.
immigr ant). W e prioritiz e focus groups with clinicians and interviews with teachers and
administr ators because qualitativ e data were not collected with these groups in our
preliminary feasibilit y pilot (only parent and student interviews were conducted). F ocus
groups and interviews will be audio-recorded and tr anscribed. T ranscripts will be
imported into Dedoose, a qualitativ e softw are progr am designed to facilitate thematic
coding. Codes will be gener ated using an integr ated approach—determined b y
participant responses and informed b y past liter ature (Br adley et al. , 2007). Codes will
be clarified and revised as necessary and broad themes will be identified.  Responses to
open-ended satisfaction questions for students and parents will also be examined for
themes. Finally , fidelit y ratings from clinicians will be examined along with satisfaction
ratings from parents and students."

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Dual language education progr ams ha ve proven to be successful for students
in schools across the United States in responding to local needs and
communities (Arias & Mark os, 2018). Students in dual language progr ams
need qualified, certified dual language educators who pro vide them the
cultur al and linguistic instruction needed at school (DeMatthews & Iz quierdo ,
2017). The feder al Every Student Succeeds Act (ES SA) was passed in 2015
and pro vides language that adv ocates for an equitable education for English
learners (ELs). ES SA pro vides recommendations for states, therefore lea ving
it up to each state to determine how they ensure that ELs are receiving an
equitable education. P art of receiving an equitable education includes
providing support for teachers.  
The following research proposal focuses on dual language teachers and their
perceptions of mentoring and induction in their first y ears as educators.
Identif ying the experiences and perceptions of mentoring and induction of
dual language teachers and their mentors within Chicago Public Schools will
lead to finding the alignment to the current shortage of bilingual education
teachers in Illinois. The shortage of bilingual education teachers in the
United States and the state of Illinois specifically is found in the Illinois State
Board of Education Supply and Demand 2020 R eport ( ISBE). For the last
three y ears, bilingual education has been named as an area of high teacher
vacancy only after special education. One on one mentoring in the first and
second y ears of a teacher are also associated with higher teacher retention
rates and impro ved student success. This study will begin in the Spring of
2022 and consist of interviewing three to fiv e dual language teachers and
coordinators at the school lev el.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
This qualitativ e study aims to understand the liv ed experiences of no vice
dual language teachers and the importance of ha ving a mentor in order to
ensure success in the classroom. F or this specific study , I will be using the
convenience sampling str ategy , using a network of dual language teachers,
leaders, and mentors to recruit and select the participants. Con venience
sampling is a t ype of nonr andom sampling where the participants are
members of the target population, are easily accessible, and are willing to
participate in the study (Suen et al. , 2014). Using m y network of centr al
office leaders and administr ators, I will begin b y contacting school principals,
assistant principals, district leaders, and dual language teachers in search of
participants who are readily a vailable for data collection. The initial email will
include a surv ey asking potential participants to pro vide their contact
information and current position. This basic interpretiv e qualitativ e study
calls for con venience sampling because it ensures that the knowledge gained
is representativ e of dual language progr ams in Chicago (Suen et al. , 2014).
Teachers will be selected from different neighborhoods in Chicago , all
emplo yed by Chicago Public Schools and working in dual language schools.
The reason for selecting teachers in dual language schools is to be able to
gather data related to the shortage of bilingual education. This data
collection will align the mentoring and induction experiences of dual
language teachers in order to find themes amongst this specific population
of educators. The first step will be to send a surv ey through google form to
all the dual language schools, the Office of Language and Cultur al Education
within the Chicago Public Schools, and the Chicago T eacher ’s Union’ s Latinx
Caucus to recruit mentors, dual language coordinators, and no vice dual
language teachers to participate. The participants selected must show that
they are mentors and leaders in volved in the planning and prepar ation of a
dual language progr am or a no vice dual language teacher .  The
characteristics of the participants desired in the initial communication 
include the following:
Novice dual language teachers in their first to three y ears teaching in a
one-way or two- way dual language progr am.
Mentors of dual language teachers prefer ably dual language teachers
themselv es, but not required.
Bilingual/ Dual Language Coordinators at the school lev el.
The interviews will be recorded, tr anscribed and coded to find common
themes. P articipants will be notified of the recording on the consent form
and prior to beginning the google meet interview . After being tr anscribed, I
will circle and highlight common themes and trends which will lead to the
findings section (R avitch & Carl, 2016).There are appro ximately a total of fort y schools within Chicago Public
Schools that currently ha ve  dual language education progr ams.  The
research study focuses on how no vice dual language teachers, mentors, and
dual language coordinators perceiv e the role of mentoring supports in the
field as well as how leaders influence the w ay dual language teachers
become tr ansformativ e leaders within their school and communit y.  In this
research study , rich, thick descriptions and triangulation will be used to
confirm findings (Merriam & Grenier , 2019). T riangulation will build on the
study to cross-check information and findings through the use of multiple
strategies used to find themes.  (Christensen & Johnson, 2017). 
Research on mentoring classroom teachers in the United States is broad,
howev er, there is little research on mentorship for dual language education
teachers and how we can reduce the shortage of dual language and bilingual
education teachers across the country . The purpose of this basic interpretiv e
qualitativ e study is to disco ver how the support that no vice dual language
teachers receiv e from their mentors and school leaders impact teacher
satisfaction, teacher retention, and student learning. This study will inform
the dev elopment of dual language education progr ams and the support
provided for dual language teachers that will be specifically implemented
within Chicago Public Schools. Through this study , I will find common trends
and solutions for the high turno ver and shortage of dual language education
teachers. The research proposal is guided b y the following questions. 
Research Questions 
1. How do no vice dual language teachers and bilingual/dual language
coordinators perceiv e the role of mentoring?
2. What t ype of mentoring do dual language teachers need to succeed in
their first y ears in the classroom? Are they receiving the supports needed?
3. To what extent do mentors and leaders in dual language education
progr ams use a reflectiv e process to inform their mentoring and induction
processes?","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The research study findings will inform possible impro vements to how school
and district leaders as well as mentoring progr ams for dual language
teachers can be implemented. Gaps in research call for a qualitativ e basic
interpretiv e research study to understand the working conditions and
demands as dual language teachers, their perceptions of mentoring and
their relationships with their mentor , principal, and assistant principal. As the
researcher , I will be using an interpretiv e and descriptiv e qualitativ e
approach that will guide me in disco vering and understanding the
perspectiv es of the participants (Merriam & Grenier , 2019).
Mentoring and other induction support are critical components for no vice
educators. ELs require more specializ ed instruction which can lead to
burnout from the stress of students performing well on English standardiz ed
exams and successfully instructing students in both languages (Soltero ,
2011). Dual language teachers specifically are faced with complex and
inconsistent policy mandates (P almer , 2018). P almer wrote about the
importance of promoting leadership amongst dual language teachers in
order to ensure that cultur al and linguistic needs of students are being met. 
In their qualitativ e analysis, Casey et al. (2013) explored the experiences of
novice bilingual education and special education teachers on the job ,
specifically looking at teachers who completed an alternativ e certification
progr am. They found that bilingual education teachers faced the following
challenges: time management, knowing what to teach, meeting the
academic needs of individual students, lesson planning, and classroom
management. They found that 56.7% of bilingual education teachers who
participated in the surv ey needed assistance in mandated bilingual education
procedures and lesson planning, 60% needed assistance in the o verall
curriculum, 36.7% needed support on individual student needs, and 66.7%
help with bilingual education paperwork (Casey et al. , 2013). The
recommendations for this study state that teacher prepar ation progr ams and
school districts need to tak e steps to plan the support needs of no vice
teachers to increase the qualit y of progr ams (Casey et al. , 2013). 
Leaders at both the school lev el and teacher prepar ation progr ams can
collabor ate to ensure that no vice teachers are supported in their first y ears
considering the challenges dual language teachers are faced with.  In their
research, R odríguez - Mojica et al. , question what it means to be a qualified
dual language teacher as well as how school leaders and univ ersities ensure
that they are preparing dual language teachers adequately (2019). Dual
language educators ha ve to be prepared to teach the curriculum in two
languages, meaning that they ha ve to ha ve a strong sense of v ocabulary in
both languages. In their autoethnogr aphy, Rodríguez - Mojica et al. found
that the following educator realiz ed that he w as not acknowledging the funds
of knowledge students came to school with. F ernando’ s family used nadien
at home which is what F ernando wrote in his paper . Howev er, his teacher
crossed off nadien and wrote nadie sending F ernando the message that thelanguage his family used did not belong in a classroom. In his
autoethnogr aphy, this educator states joining the bilingual teacher
prepar ation workforce to mentor and tr ain no vice educators to ev entually
break this cy cle (R odriguez -Mojica. , 2019). 
The bilingual education teacher shortage can be impro ved by ensuring that
teacher prepar ation progr ams ha ve set standards that expand on the
pedagogical sociolinguistic ideas of future educators (Arias & F ee, 2018).
Teacher prepar ation progr ams can help future educators engage in the
process of dev eloping their ideological clarit y which will lead to knowledge of
the cultur al and linguistic assets that their students bring to the school and
classroom communit y. Before being able to help their students grow ,
teachers ha ve to be able to self -reflect as part of their professional learning
as educators (Alfaro , 2019). 
In their qualitativ e study , Fránquiz et al. found str ategies that can be utiliz ed
when tr aining pre and in service dual language educators (2019). The steps
include creating professional dev elopment spaces where teachers can use
their own ideological clarit y to build on the curriculum in response to the
needs of the communit y as well as creating a space where tr anslanguaging
is embr aced. T eachers also learn about the history , laws, and policies that
impact their students including their cultur al and linguistic human rights.
Finally , use the funds of knowledge that students and their families bring to
the school communit y (Fránquiz et al. , 2019). The study consisted of the
researchers using the critical pedagogy theory of dialogue, reflection, and
action to analyz e how two teachers in a tr ansfronteriz o communit y
(borderland) use identit y texts in their dual language classrooms (Fránquiz
et al., 2019). The teachers in the study use identit y texts to teach a unit on
immigr ation.  The students and their families engaged in dialogue and were
able to create their own identit y texts based on their own immigr ation
narratives (Fránquiz et al. , 2019). Through analyzing texts, the students
were able to pose problems on complex social justice issues and ev entually
will be able to tak e action and tr ansform the world.","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
The first step of data collection is an initial google forms surv ey that will be
emailed to all of the principals, assistant principals, district leaders, mentors
and no vice teachers working in a dual language setting or context. The initial
survey will be used to recruit participants. The questionnaire will allow the
researcher to measure a set of themes and from there select the number of
participants for the interview and observ ation data collection (Johnson &
Christensen, 2017). The google form will ask the potential participants for
the following: name, email, phone number (optional), current role, school,
and pro vide an explanation of the research project. Once the google forms
are submitted, I will be able to determine 3-5 participants to be interviewed
through a google meet. The participants will consist of at least one dual
language and at least two no vice teachers. The interview process will
continue for one to two months in order to get a div erse r ange of data. Prior
to beginning the interview process, I will ha ve the participants sign the
consent form electronically . The virtual interviews will be 60 minutes long
and two interviews will be scheduled, the second one as a follow up of the
first. The interviews will be tr anscribed looking for similarities, differences
and finding themes and dev eloping categories. Pseudan yms will be used
with an y information shared (school name, teacher name, neighborhood,
etc). Semi-structured interviews will be planned to use a protocol with
questions and probes to obtain response clarit y or additional information
(Johnson & Christensen, 2017).","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
This qualitativ e study aims to understand the liv ed experiences of no vice
dual language teachers and the importance of ha ving a mentor in order to
ensure success in the classroom. In this section, I will explain the data
collection and analysis process. F or this specific study , I will be using the
convenience sampling str ategy , using a network of dual language teachers,
leaders, and mentors to recruit and select the participants. Con venience
sampling is a t ype of nonr andom sampling where the participants are
members of the target population, are easily accessible, and are willing to
participate in the study (Suen et al. , 2014). Using m y network of centr al
office leaders and administr ators, I will begin b y contacting school principals,
assistant principals, district leaders, and dual language teachers in search of
participants who are readily a vailable for data collection. The initial email will
include a surv ey asking potential participants to pro vide their contact
information and current position. This basic interpretiv e qualitativ e study
calls for con venience sampling because it ensures that the knowledge gained
is representativ e of dual language progr ams in Chicago (Suen et al. , 2014).
Teachers will be selected from different neighborhoods in Chicago , all
emplo yed by Chicago Public Schools and working in dual language schools.
The reason for selecting teachers in dual language schools is to be able to
gather data related to the shortage of bilingual education. This data
collection will align the mentoring and induction experiences of dual
language teachers in order to find themes amongst this specific population
of educators. The first step will be to send a surv ey through google form to
all the dual language schools, the Office of Language and Cultur al Education
within the Chicago Public Schools, and the Chicago T eacher ’s Union’ s Latinx
Caucus to recruit mentors, dual language coordinators, and no vice dual
language teachers to participate. The participants selected must show that
they are mentors and leaders in volved in the planning and prepar ation of a
dual language progr am or a no vice dual language teacher . The interviews
will be tr anscribed and coded to find common themes. After being
transcribed, I will circle and highlight common themes and trends which will
lead to the findings section (R avitch & Carl, 2016)."

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Since 2011, AIR has been the external ev aluator for the Communit y Schools
Initiativ e (CSI). Since CSI is largely supported with 21st Century Communit y
Learning Centers gr ant funding pro vided b y the Illinois State Board of
Education, Chicago Public Schools is required to conduct a local ev aluation of
CSI progr ams. AIR pro vides the ev aluation services needed for CPS to meet
this gr ant requirement.
As part of these ev aluation activities, AIR will be collecting y outh surv ey
data in relation to CSI afterschool activities. More specifically , the y outh
survey is designed to assess student experiences in afterschool
progr amming, motiv ation to attend, perceptions of how they ha ve benefited
from afterschool progr am participation, and to obtain information on basic
respondent demogr aphics.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Afterschool data collection activities will be oriented at answering the
following set of ev aluation questions:
 1) To what extent are CSI afterschool activities pro vided at sampled schools
designed and deliv ered in a manner consistent with research-supported
instructional pr actices?
2) To what extent do students participating in CSI afterschool activities
report ha ving experiences in progr amming that are associated with positiv e
youth dev elopment?
3) How do students participating in CSI afterschool activities report
benefiting from their participation in progr amming?
We hypothesiz e that schools which ha ve implemented the communit y school
strategy with greater fidelit y to the CSI Implementation Fr amework and
which support greater adoption of research-supported instructional pr actices
will be associated with more positiv e youth experiences in progr amming and
a broader arr ay of perceiv ed benefits from participation.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The purpose of this research is to twofold:  (1) to document the extent to
which CSI afterschool progr amming is being deliv ered in a manner
consistent with research-supported pr actices and what this means in terms
of youth experiences in progr amming and perceiv ed benefit and (2) to
explore how both y outh experiences and perceiv ed outcomes ma y be
associated with k ey elements of communit y school implementation. These
results are needed both to respond to ISBE ev aluation requirements
associated with the 21st CCL C progr am, as well as to inform efforts b y the
CPS CSI team and individual schools to support efforts to impro ve
implementation of the communit y school str ategy .
 Progr ams lik e those being pro vided in CSI schools in the afterschool of 2021
are more lik ely to ha ve an impact if they are high qualit y (Durlak,
Weissberg, &P achan, 2010; Naftz ger, Hallberg, & Y ang, 2014). Progr am
qualit y can be understood in terms of process qualit y (meaning the adoption
of practices and approaches to service deliv ery that result in
developmentally appropriate settings) and contentqualit y (referring to
content -specific pr actices meant to cultiv ate specific skills, beliefs, or
knowledge). T o collect data relating to process qualit y, we propose using the
Youth Progr am Qualit y Assessment (F orum for Y outh In vestment, 2012), the
most commonly used observ ation tool in the field (Naftz ger, Dev aney, &
Newman, 2015).
 For youth to benefit from progr amming, they need to attend progr amming—
ideally , at high
levels—and participate in a v ariety of activities (Naftz ger et al. ,
2018;Fredricks & Eccles, 2006). Being merely present in the progr am is not
enough, howev er, to ensure that y outh will benefit from the activities. They
also need to experience both engagement and interest during the activities
to dev elop the beliefs, skills, and knowledge that can help them succeed in
school and bey ond (Christenson, R eschly , & W ylie, 2012; Greene, Lee,
Constance, & Hynes, 2013; Mohr -Schroeder et al. , 2014; Shernoff & V andell,
2007). In theory , the extent to which progr ams effectiv ely adopt pr actices
related to process qualit y and content -specific pr actices should hea vily
influence the degree of engagement and interest that y outh experience
while participating in afterschool progr amming.
 The liter ature also suggests that participation in high-qualit y out-of-school
time progr amming can support a v ariety of outcomes, including the
following:
 Youth Agency and P ositiv e Self -Concept. Y outh can dev elop positiv e mind-
sets and beliefs about their capacities, including confidence and a sense of
self-efficacy through participation in high-qualit y out-of-school time
progr ams. Man y of the opportunities afforded to y outh in high-qualit yprogr ams also pro vide y outh with the opportunit y to experience a sense of
agency b y allowing choice and autonom y in progr am offerings (Beymer et
al., 2018; Larson & Angus, 2011; Naftz ger & Sniegowski, 2018; Nagaoka,
2016). As Larson and Da wes (2015) assert, this sense of agency is
particularly important starting in early adolescence, enabling y outh to utiliz e
emerging cognitiv e skills, such as higher order reasoning and greater
executiv e control of their own thought processes to more effectiv ely solv e
problems and tak e the steps needed to achiev e goals they are pursuing. This
provides y outh with feedback about what they can accomplish and their
ability to solv e problems and o vercome challenges, enhancing an underlying
sense of self -efficacy and competence.
 New Sustained Interests. Out -of-school tome progr amming can also afford
youth the opportunit y to experience new things, which supports both
identit y dev elopment and y oung people’ s abilit y to mak e sense of
themselv es and the world around them, as well as dev elop new interests in
domain-specific content areas, such as STEM and the arts. Interest
development is a critical component of y outh growth and y outh dev elopment
and has been link ed to numerous motiv ational elements related to learning,
including goal-directed beha vior, self-efficacy , self-regulation, and
achiev ement v alue (R enninger & Hidi, 2011).
 Belonging/Mattering. Y outh participating in high-qualit y out-of-school time 
progr ams can also experience a sense of belonging and mattering through
positiv e and supportiv e relationships, both with activit y leaders and their
peers in the progr am (Akiv a, Cortina, Eccles, & Smith, 2013; A uger, Pierce,
& Vandell, 2013; Durlak & W eissberg, 2007; K auh, 2011; Larson & Da wes,
2015; Miller , 2007; Naftz ger & Sniegowski, 2018; T raill, Broha wn, & Caruso ,
2013). These experiences are important because y outh who ha ve positiv e
relationships and meaningful friendships demonstr ate better emotional well-
being, prosocial beha viors, and better academic performance than y outh
lacking such relationships (W entzel, Donlan, & Morrison, 2012).
 Knowledge and Skills. Y outh participating in high-qualit y out-of-school time
progr ams also ha ve the opportunit y to learn new content and dev elop and
practice new skills. F or example, the dev elopment of interpersonal skills has
been commonly identified b y practitioners as being one skill domain in
particular that seemingly appears to be positiv ely impacted b y sustained
youth participation in progr amming (Sniegowski et al. , 2019).","to Date
During the course of the 2020-21 school y ear, a total of 302 y outh from 13

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Since 2011, AIR has been the external ev aluator for the Communit y Schools
Initiativ e (CSI). Since CSI is largely supported with 21st Century Communit y
Learning Centers gr ant funding pro vided b y the Illinois State Board of
Education, Chicago Public Schools is required to conduct a local ev aluation of
CSI progr ams. AIR pro vides the ev aluation services needed for CPS to meet
this gr ant requirement.
As part of these ev aluation activities, AIR will be collecting y outh surv ey
data in relation to CSI afterschool activities. More specifically , the y outh
survey is designed to assess student experiences in afterschool
progr amming, motiv ation to attend, perceptions of how they ha ve benefited
from afterschool progr am participation, and to obtain information on basic
respondent demogr aphics.Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Afterschool data collection activities will be oriented at answering the
following set of ev aluation questions:
 1) To what extent are CSI afterschool activities pro vided at sampled schools
designed and deliv ered in a manner consistent with research-supported
instructional pr actices?
2) To what extent do students participating in CSI afterschool activities
report ha ving experiences in progr amming that are associated with positiv e
youth dev elopment?
3) How do students participating in CSI afterschool activities report
benefiting from their participation in progr amming?
We hypothesiz e that schools which ha ve implemented the communit y school
strategy with greater fidelit y to the CSI Implementation Fr amework and
which support greater adoption of research-supported instructional pr actices
will be associated with more positiv e youth experiences in progr amming and
a broader arr ay of perceiv ed benefits from participation.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The purpose of this research is to twofold:  (1) to document the extent to
which CSI afterschool progr amming is being deliv ered in a manner
consistent with research-supported pr actices and what this means in terms
of youth experiences in progr amming and perceiv ed benefit and (2) to
explore how both y outh experiences and perceiv ed outcomes ma y be
associated with k ey elements of communit y school implementation. These
results are needed both to respond to ISBE ev aluation requirements
associated with the 21st CCL C progr am, as well as to inform efforts b y the
CPS CSI team and individual schools to support efforts to impro ve
implementation of the communit y school str ategy .
 Progr ams lik e those being pro vided in CSI schools in the afterschool of 2021
are more lik ely to ha ve an impact if they are high qualit y (Durlak,
Weissberg, &P achan, 2010; Naftz ger, Hallberg, & Y ang, 2014). Progr am
qualit y can be understood in terms of process qualit y (meaning the adoption
of practices and approaches to service deliv ery that result in
developmentally appropriate settings) and contentqualit y (referring to
content -specific pr actices meant to cultiv ate specific skills, beliefs, or
knowledge). T o collect data relating to process qualit y, we propose using the
Youth Progr am Qualit y Assessment (F orum for Y outh In vestment, 2012), the
most commonly used observ ation tool in the field (Naftz ger, Dev aney, &
Newman, 2015).
 For youth to benefit from progr amming, they need to attend progr amming—
ideally , at high
levels—and participate in a v ariety of activities (Naftz ger et al. ,
2018;Fredricks & Eccles, 2006). Being merely present in the progr am is not
enough, howev er, to ensure that y outh will benefit from the activities. They
also need to experience both engagement and interest during the activities
to dev elop the beliefs, skills, and knowledge that can help them succeed in
school and bey ond (Christenson, R eschly , & W ylie, 2012; Greene, Lee,
Constance, & Hynes, 2013; Mohr -Schroeder et al. , 2014; Shernoff & V andell,
2007). In theory , the extent to which progr ams effectiv ely adopt pr actices
related to process qualit y and content -specific pr actices should hea vily
influence the degree of engagement and interest that y outh experience
while participating in afterschool progr amming.
 The liter ature also suggests that participation in high-qualit y out-of-school
time progr amming can support a v ariety of outcomes, including the
following:
 Youth Agency and P ositiv e Self -Concept. Y outh can dev elop positiv e mind-
sets and beliefs about their capacities, including confidence and a sense of
self-efficacy through participation in high-qualit y out-of-school time
progr ams. Man y of the opportunities afforded to y outh in high-qualit yprogr ams also pro vide y outh with the opportunit y to experience a sense of
agency b y allowing choice and autonom y in progr am offerings (Beymer et
al., 2018; Larson & Angus, 2011; Naftz ger & Sniegowski, 2018; Nagaoka,
2016). As Larson and Da wes (2015) assert, this sense of agency is
particularly important starting in early adolescence, enabling y outh to utiliz e
emerging cognitiv e skills, such as higher order reasoning and greater
executiv e control of their own thought processes to more effectiv ely solv e
problems and tak e the steps needed to achiev e goals they are pursuing. This
provides y outh with feedback about what they can accomplish and their
ability to solv e problems and o vercome challenges, enhancing an underlying
sense of self -efficacy and competence.
 New Sustained Interests. Out -of-school tome progr amming can also afford
youth the opportunit y to experience new things, which supports both
identit y dev elopment and y oung people’ s abilit y to mak e sense of
themselv es and the world around them, as well as dev elop new interests in
domain-specific content areas, such as STEM and the arts. Interest
development is a critical component of y outh growth and y outh dev elopment
and has been link ed to numerous motiv ational elements related to learning,
including goal-directed beha vior, self-efficacy , self-regulation, and
achiev ement v alue (R enninger & Hidi, 2011).
 Belonging/Mattering. Y outh participating in high-qualit y out-of-school time 
progr ams can also experience a sense of belonging and mattering through
positiv e and supportiv e relationships, both with activit y leaders and their
peers in the progr am (Akiv a, Cortina, Eccles, & Smith, 2013; A uger, Pierce,
& Vandell, 2013; Durlak & W eissberg, 2007; K auh, 2011; Larson & Da wes,
2015; Miller , 2007; Naftz ger & Sniegowski, 2018; T raill, Broha wn, & Caruso ,
2013). These experiences are important because y outh who ha ve positiv e
relationships and meaningful friendships demonstr ate better emotional well-
being, prosocial beha viors, and better academic performance than y outh
lacking such relationships (W entzel, Donlan, & Morrison, 2012).
 Knowledge and Skills. Y outh participating in high-qualit y out-of-school time
progr ams also ha ve the opportunit y to learn new content and dev elop and
practice new skills. F or example, the dev elopment of interpersonal skills has
been commonly identified b y practitioners as being one skill domain in
particular that seemingly appears to be positiv ely impacted b y sustained
youth participation in progr amming (Sniegowski et al. , 2019).Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
In fall of 2018, Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Office of Student Health and
Wellness (OSHW) has entered into a 5- year cooper ative agreement with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention, Department of Adolescent and
School Health (CDC -DASH). The funding pro vided through this cooper ative
agreement supports the implementation and ev aluation of the HIV/STI
Prevention Initiativ e within CPS . For this initiativ e, the P olicy, Practice and
Prevention R esearch Center (P3RC) at the Univ ersity of Illinois at Chicago
School of Public Health is pro viding CPS with ev aluation support. The role of
the P3RC ev aluation staff is to support the CPS team in the tr acking and
reporting of performance and process measures required b y CDC -DASH. In
addition, the ev aluation team will be conducting activities to answer
additional progr am ev aluation questions to assess progr am qualit y and
effectiv eness including tr aining qualit y and stak eholder perceptions of
initiativ es that will inform ongoing capacit y building and technical assistance
provided b y the district.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The ev aluation plan co-dev eloped between the P3RC and OSHW aligns with
CDC gr ant requirements and outlines the methods for collecting performance
and process measures data directly from schools through electronic surv eys,
in-person meetings, and on-site observ ation b y CPS staff members.
The CDC mandates the following ev aluation questions: 1. T o what extent do
districts and schools pro vide effectiv e sexual health education to students?
2. To what extent do districts and schools pro vide access to k ey sexual
health services for students? 3. T o what extent are districts and schools
providing safe and supportiv e environments for students? The role of the
evaluation team in addressing the abo ve questions is simply to pro vide
advice and technical support.
The following additional ev aluation questions ha ve already been included
and appro ved in previous RRB modification submissions: 1. What are the
characteristics of sexual health education (SHE) implementation in schools?
What are facilitators and barriers to SHE implementation? 2. How is capacit y
for sexual health promotion built among Sexual Health Advisory Committee
(SHAC) members? How are relationships built? How are resources shared, if
at all? 3. What are the char acteristics of the implementation of linkage to
sexual health services (SHS) str ategies in schools? What are facilitators and
barriers to SHS str ategy implementation? 4. How do Professional Learning
Communities (PL C) (groups of teachers and school staff who meet regularly
to discuss challenges and share str ategies and lessons learned with one
another) support the capacit y to implement SHE, SHS and S SE str ategies?
What are the strengths and challenges of the PL C model? 5. What are the
characteristics of the implementation of safe and supportiv e environment
(SSE) str ategies in schools? What are facilitators and barriers to S SE
strategy implementation? How are L GBTQ+ students being supported
through Genders and Sexualities Alliances during the pandemic? What
lessons can be learned b y those who are currently activ e and shared with
other schools? 6. How are parents/caregiv ers in volved in SHE discussions
with their children? What are the facilitators and barriers to engaging
parents/caregiv ers in con versations about SHE? How are parents being
engaged during the pandemic in SHS , SHE, and S SE activities? 7. What are
schools currently doing to address mental health needs of students,
particularly in light of the pandemic? What supports do schools need in
connecting students with needed services? How and in what w ays could
mental health services and sexual health services referr als resources and
systems complement one another? What could be done to assist schools in
making these referr als? 8. How are new aspects of the updated SHE policy
being implemented? How is sex education being implemented in pre-
Kindergarten settings? 9. What are best pr actices for GS A formation,
engagement, and sustainabilit y in high schools and K -8 schools? What is the
perceiv ed value of the GS A? What are ex emplary and/or inno vative GSA
practices?
The following additional ev aluation questions and accompan ying protocols
and instruments are being submitted in winter 2023 for appro val: 1. Whatare the learning, skill dev elopment, and implementation outcomes of the
SHE instructor tr aining? How are new aspects of the updated SHE policy
being implemented? How is SHE being implemented with div erse learners?
2. What are the pr actices that facilitate High Schools’ abilit y to implement
SHE in gr ades 10-12? 3. How is the condom a vailabilit y progr am (CAP) being
implemented in both K -8 and high schools? What are the specific challenges,
barriers, facilitators to implementation and what additional support and
resources are needed in schools? 4. What are the challenges, lessons
learned, and best pr actices of coaches and staff members supporting
student athletes who identif y as non-binary/gender expansiv e? 5. What are
the experiences, learnings, and perceiv ed influence of participation in the
Gender Inclusivit y PLC con vened for science teachers b y OSHW and the
Office of T eaching and Learning? It is h ypothesiz ed that this initiativ e will
achiev e the following objectiv es: 1) Decrease in sexual risk beha viors among
adolescents; 2) Increase use of condoms and highly effectiv e contr aception
methods among sexually activ e adolescents; 3) Increase adolescents’ access
to key sexual health services; and 4) Increase in students feeling safe and
supported at school. The ev aluation will assist the team in achieving these
goals b y informing the support and technical assistance pro vided to schools.
The following additional ev aluation questions and accompan ying protocols

skills of staff and students who attend the GS A Summit change as a result of
attending the Summit? (Summit surv ey analysis)","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
An arr ay of str ategies ha ve demonstr ated evidence as protectiv e for L GBTQ+
students’ wellbeing and educational success (P almer et al. , 2017), foremost
among them the creation of Genders and Sexualities Alliance (GS A) clubs in
schools (K osciw et al. , 2019). Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has prioritiz ed
supporting GS A growth throughout the district, identif ying the goal of each
school ha ving a GS A in its fiv e year vision (CPS , 2019). Additionally ,
research has indicated that comprehensiv e sexual health (CSE) education
provides students the abilit y to learn concepts and master skills necessary
lead sexual health y lives as they dev elop into adulthood (Br assard &
Fiorvanti, 2015). CSE is link ed to impro ved dating and interpersonal
violence-related outcomes, greater acceptance of sexual div ersity among
students, and impro ved outcomes related to social/emotional learning and
media liter acy, in addition to reductions in pregnancies and STIs (Goldfarb &
Lieberman, 2021). R ecognizing these benefits, Chicago Public School (CPS)
updated its Sexual Health Education (SHE) policy in 2020, requiring schools
to pro vide comprehensiv e sexual health education (SHE) to Pre-K students
and tr aining to Pre-K teachers. In an effort to identif y best pr actices for
initiating and sustaining GS As in schools, supporting all schools across the
district in implementing CSE, the ev aluation team pro vides support to the
OSHW L GBTQ+ and Sexual Health T eam to support their work. A strong
literature base supports all the work that the OSHW's L GBTQ+ and Sexual
Health T eam is doing to support schools, these are just two examples.","to Date

OSHW and the P3RC ev aluation team conducted 21 semi-structured k ey
informant interviews with SHE instructors who ha ve taken the SHE tr aining
during the SY22-23 school y ear. During SHE instructor tr ainings, OSHW
asked participants if they were interested in participating in follow -up
interviews. OSHW pro vided UIC/P3RC personnel with a list of participants
who identified interest. Questions co vered o verall feedback and experience
of the SHE instructor tr aining and implementing sexual health education in
their school. In addition, instructors’ perspectiv es on whether and how the
SHE instructor tr aining helped facilitate the implementation of sexual health
education in their school and classroom and other factors that helped
promote or hinder the implementation of sexual health education in their
school and classroom will be obtained during the interviews. P articipants will
be ask ed to participate in a 45–60-minute interview held virtually on a video

OSHW distributed a surv ey that w as co-designed b y the UIC/P3RC and
OSHW teams to the staff member at each CPS school who has beendesignated as the ""Sexual Health Services"" designee for their school during
the SY2022-2023 school y ear. The surv ey questions ask ed about the
logistics of the Condom A vailabilit y Progr am, the barriers, and successes
since the implementation of the progr am, and what specific supports are
needed at the school. The surv ey link w as distributed via email to the SHS
designee at each school. The participants were ask ed to participate in a 10-

What are the challenges, lessons learned, and best pr actices of coaches and
staff members supporting student athletes who identif y as TNBGNC?
The UIC/P3RC team conducted interviews with coaches who participated in a
PD to learn about how to better support L GBTQ+ student athletes to gather
information regarding perceiv ed benefits of the tr aining, an y need for
impro vements, and recommendations to impro ve the PD . These were
conducted 6 months following the No vember 8th tr aining conducted jointly
by OSHW and the Office of Student Protections (OSP). Interviews lasted
about 45-60 minutes and were conducted virtually . A total of 4 interviews

What are the experiences, learnings, and perceiv ed influence of participation
in the Gender Inclusivit y PLC con vened for science teachers b y OSHW and
the Office of T eaching and Learning?
CPS OSHW and the Office of T eaching and Learning (O TL) co-dev eloped a
Professional Learning Communit y (PLC) focused on Gender Inclusivit y that is
designed to build initiativ e school staff members’ capacit y to implement
district science curricula in a w ay that is inclusiv e of all gender identities.
There were monthly meetings throughout the school y ear during which
participants work ed on projects . A total of 10 interviews were conducted at
the end of the school y ear to assess o verall learnings, reflections, and

What is the perceiv ed value of the GS A Summit from the perspectiv es of
staff and students?
The Galaxy Summit is an ev ent that tak es place on an annual basis and
allows all GS A members and sponsors across the district to come together
for a da y of learning, connection, and communit y. The OSHW team has a
desire to understand how participants view the da y’s events, the relev ance
of sessions offered, and the degree to which the ev ents and activities allow
networking and learning to occur . A post ev aluation assessment for each
session as well as a post ev aluation surv ey for the entire da y’s events ha ve
been created in collabor ation with the OSHW team, the GS A Leadership
Committee, as well as with input from current GS A students. Ev aluations
were administered b y OSHW during the Summit on Ma y 20, 2023. A total of50 full da y evaluations were collected and a total of 250 individual session
evaluations were collected. Analysis is complete and findings were shared
with the GS ALC and OSHW .
What is the perceiv ed value of the GS A Leadership Committee (GS ALC)?
How does it function to support sponsors and their
development/sustainment of GS As in their schools?
The GS ALC is an inno vative support structure launched and supported b y
OSHW and led b y GSA sponsors. This group w as initiated in F all of 2020 and
has ev olved in membership and purpose o ver time. The OSHW team has a
desire to understand how GS ALC members view the group , its mission, its
activities, its go vernance, and its functioning. This y ear we again conducted
interviews with OSHW staff who support the GS ALC and two focus group
with the two GS ALC subcommittees, those working on planning the Galaxy
Summit and those working on planning communit y building activities.
Analysis is complete and findings were shared with the GS ALC and OSHW .
How do participants in the GS ALC’s communit y building activities experience
participation?
The GS ALC Communit y Building Subcommittee has created a series of
activities for both students and staff to participate in to facilitate learning,
networking, and spaces of jo y and affirmation. UIC created a template
evaluation surv ey for OSHW to tailor and administer for specific Communit y
Building activities and ev ents.Preliminary Results to Date
Sexual Health Services
Findings from the Condom A vailabilit y Surv ey: A total of 243 surv eys were
collected from 242 schools. The first hundred and thirt y three participants
receiv ed a $15 gift card.
Findings rev ealed that 81% of respondents reported their school w as
participating in the condom a vailabilit y progr am. Common areas to pro vide
condoms included bo xes/bask ets/bowls (62%), the primary forms of
communication about CAP were word of mouth (27%), announcements
(24%), and posters (22%), and v ery few schools reported an y ongoing
issues with student beha vior related to CAP (60%). In this modification we
are proposing conducting interviews with some of those respondents to
explore specific challenges experienced b y some schools in greater depth.
Safe and Supportiv e Environments
PLC interviews: Preliminary findings rev eal that the PL C was well-receiv ed by
facilitators and participants alik e. Specific feedback on PL C components
included belief that there were shared norms for the group , the learning
activities fostered reflection and critical thinking, and that the projects were
meaningful and aligned with the PL C’s overall purpose. P articipants shared
that there is more opportunit y for more collabor ation across groups and an
opportunit y for more structured feedback on participants’ ongoing projects.
Coaches interviews:
Preliminary findings rev ealed that the professional dev elopment w as well-
receiv ed by coaches y et they reported a desire for more concrete specific
lessons learned from other coaches who had work ed directly with students
who identif y as TNBGNC. Only one coach reported ha ving work ed with a
TNBGNC student athlete and reported that the lessons learned in the
training were useful in supporting that student.
Sexual Health Education findings were shared at APHA and are attached.
Findings shared with the GS ALC are also attached.

GSA Summit Surv ey:
We have previously submitted the GS A Summit ev aluation for appro val with
the CPS RRB and receiv ed appro val. This w as previously submitted as an
amendment in March of 2022. This included that post surv eys to assess
satisfaction and learning would be conducted with both staff and students
following the district -led annual GS A Summit one da y event.
A pre-surv ey will be administered along with the Summit registr ation. A
post-survey will be administered at the end of the da y at the Summit itself .
Additionally , a follow -up surv ey will be administered to all Summit
participants in Ma y of 2024 to assess possible impact of the Summit on
behaviors such as utilization of resources shared at the Summit or of actions
taken by GSA advisers to support their GS As.
At this time we are expanding this ev aluation effort to include pre, post, and
follow -up surv eys. F or the purpose of linking the data across these time
points we are now proposing that CPS will collect the data using their own
platforms, link the responses, and use a code not link ed to an y identifiers to
link them. This de-identified data will then be shared with UIC for the
purposes of analysis.
*****PREVIOUSL Y APPROVED DA TA COMPONENT S*******
CAP Surv ey:
The Office of Student Health and W ellness will be distributing the surv ey to
the staff member at each CPS school who has been designated as the
""Sexual Health Services"" designee for their school. This is a position required
for each school to ha ve in accordance with Health y CPS . The surv ey is
electronic, and should not tak e more than 10 minutes for staff members to
complete. The surv ey will be open for 3 months for staff members to
complete. The first page of the surv ey presents the purpose of the surv ey,
how the data will be used and that it will be shared with the Office of
Student Health and W ellness, and the only identifier being collected is the
school name and the staff person's name and email address. No other
identifiers will be collected.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
GSA Summit Surv ey:
CPS will collect and store the data. Once data is cleaned, link ed, and de-
identified it will be securely tr ansferred to UIC. A t UIC data will be stored on
a password-protected file sharing platform called UIC Bo x (which is appro ved
by the UIC IRB) and will be only accessible to UIC staff assigned to this
project.
*****PREVIOUSL Y APPROVED DA TA COMPONENT S*******CAP Surv ey:
A master k ey will be created to link the school names to the schools’ codes,
but will be destro yed after the analysis is completed. The data file

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
In fall of 2018, Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Office of Student Health and
Wellness (OSHW) has entered into a 5- year cooper ative agreement with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention, Department of Adolescent and
School Health (CDC -DASH). The funding pro vided through this cooper ative
agreement supports the implementation and ev aluation of the HIV/STI
Prevention Initiativ e within CPS . For this initiativ e, the P olicy, Practice and
Prevention R esearch Center (P3RC) at the Univ ersity of Illinois at Chicago
School of Public Health is pro viding CPS with ev aluation support. The role of
the P3RC ev aluation staff is to support the CPS team in the tr acking and
reporting of performance and process measures required b y CDC -DASH. In
addition, the ev aluation team will be conducting activities to answer
additional progr am ev aluation questions to assess progr am qualit y and
effectiv eness including tr aining qualit y and stak eholder perceptions of
initiativ es that will inform ongoing capacit y building and technical assistance
provided b y the district.Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The ev aluation plan co-dev eloped between the P3RC and OSHW aligns with
CDC gr ant requirements and outlines the methods for collecting performance
and process measures data directly from schools through electronic surv eys,
in-person meetings, and on-site observ ation b y CPS staff members.
The CDC mandates the following ev aluation questions: 1. T o what extent do
districts and schools pro vide effectiv e sexual health education to students?
2. To what extent do districts and schools pro vide access to k ey sexual
health services for students? 3. T o what extent are districts and schools
providing safe and supportiv e environments for students? The role of the
evaluation team in addressing the abo ve questions is simply to pro vide
advice and technical support.
The following additional ev aluation questions ha ve already been included
and appro ved in previous RRB modification submissions: 1. What are the
characteristics of sexual health education (SHE) implementation in schools?
What are facilitators and barriers to SHE implementation? 2. How is capacit y
for sexual health promotion built among Sexual Health Advisory Committee
(SHAC) members? How are relationships built? How are resources shared, if
at all? 3. What are the char acteristics of the implementation of linkage to
sexual health services (SHS) str ategies in schools? What are facilitators and
barriers to SHS str ategy implementation? 4. How do Professional Learning
Communities (PL C) (groups of teachers and school staff who meet regularly
to discuss challenges and share str ategies and lessons learned with one
another) support the capacit y to implement SHE, SHS and S SE str ategies?
What are the strengths and challenges of the PL C model? 5. What are the
characteristics of the implementation of safe and supportiv e environment
(SSE) str ategies in schools? What are facilitators and barriers to S SE
strategy implementation? How are L GBTQ+ students being supported
through Genders and Sexualities Alliances during the pandemic? What
lessons can be learned b y those who are currently activ e and shared with
other schools? 6. How are parents/caregiv ers in volved in SHE discussions
with their children? What are the facilitators and barriers to engaging
parents/caregiv ers in con versations about SHE? How are parents being
engaged during the pandemic in SHS , SHE, and S SE activities? 7. What are
schools currently doing to address mental health needs of students,
particularly in light of the pandemic? What supports do schools need in
connecting students with needed services? How and in what w ays could
mental health services and sexual health services referr als resources and
systems complement one another? What could be done to assist schools in
making these referr als? 8. How are new aspects of the updated SHE policy
being implemented? How is sex education being implemented in pre-
Kindergarten settings? 9. What are best pr actices for GS A formation,
engagement, and sustainabilit y in high schools and K -8 schools? What is the
perceiv ed value of the GS A? What are ex emplary and/or inno vative GSA
practices?
The following additional ev aluation questions and accompan ying protocols
and instruments are being submitted in winter 2023 for appro val: 1. Whatare the learning, skill dev elopment, and implementation outcomes of the
SHE instructor tr aining? How are new aspects of the updated SHE policy
being implemented? How is SHE being implemented with div erse learners?
2. What are the pr actices that facilitate High Schools’ abilit y to implement
SHE in gr ades 10-12? 3. How is the condom a vailabilit y progr am (CAP) being
implemented in both K -8 and high schools? What are the specific challenges,
barriers, facilitators to implementation and what additional support and
resources are needed in schools? 4. What are the challenges, lessons
learned, and best pr actices of coaches and staff members supporting
student athletes who identif y as non-binary/gender expansiv e? 5. What are
the experiences, learnings, and perceiv ed influence of participation in the
Gender Inclusivit y PLC con vened for science teachers b y OSHW and the
Office of T eaching and Learning? It is h ypothesiz ed that this initiativ e will
achiev e the following objectiv es: 1) Decrease in sexual risk beha viors among
adolescents; 2) Increase use of condoms and highly effectiv e contr aception
methods among sexually activ e adolescents; 3) Increase adolescents’ access
to key sexual health services; and 4) Increase in students feeling safe and
supported at school. The ev aluation will assist the team in achieving these
goals b y informing the support and technical assistance pro vided to schools.
The following additional ev aluation questions and accompan ying protocols
and instruments are being submitted in March 2023 for appro val: 1) How is
the CAP policy being implemented in both K -8 and high schools? What are
the specific challenges, barriers, facilitators to implementation and what
additional support and resources are needed in schools?; 2) What are the
challenges, lessons learned, and best pr actices of coaches and staff
members supporting student athletes who identif y as L GBTQ+?; and 3)
What are the experiences of the mentees in the GS A Sponsor Mentorship
progr am? 
 
The following additional ev aluation questions and accompan ying protocols
and instruments are being submitted in fall 2023 for appro val: 1. What are
the experiences of SHE teachers implementing the new SHE curricula? Is it
appropriate, accessible, feasible, and what are their perceptions of its impact
on student engagement and learning? (SHE focus groups) 2. How do SHS
designees understand their role? What are the specific challenges, barriers,
facilitators to implementation and what additional support and resources are
needed in schools who are not implementing the progr am?  What are the
strategies of those who ha ve successfully address parent
questions/concerns? (SHS CAP interviews) 3. How do the knowledge and
skills of staff and students who attend the GS A Summit change as a result of
attending the Summit? (Summit surv ey analysis)Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
An arr ay of str ategies ha ve demonstr ated evidence as protectiv e for L GBTQ+
students’ wellbeing and educational success (P almer et al. , 2017), foremost
among them the creation of Genders and Sexualities Alliance (GS A) clubs in
schools (K osciw et al. , 2019). Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has prioritiz ed
supporting GS A growth throughout the district, identif ying the goal of each
school ha ving a GS A in its fiv e year vision (CPS , 2019). Additionally ,
research has indicated that comprehensiv e sexual health (CSE) education
provides students the abilit y to learn concepts and master skills necessary
lead sexual health y lives as they dev elop into adulthood (Br assard &
Fiorvanti, 2015). CSE is link ed to impro ved dating and interpersonal
violence-related outcomes, greater acceptance of sexual div ersity among
students, and impro ved outcomes related to social/emotional learning and
media liter acy, in addition to reductions in pregnancies and STIs (Goldfarb &
Lieberman, 2021). R ecognizing these benefits, Chicago Public School (CPS)
updated its Sexual Health Education (SHE) policy in 2020, requiring schools
to pro vide comprehensiv e sexual health education (SHE) to Pre-K students
and tr aining to Pre-K teachers. In an effort to identif y best pr actices for
initiating and sustaining GS As in schools, supporting all schools across the
district in implementing CSE, the ev aluation team pro vides support to the
OSHW L GBTQ+ and Sexual Health T eam to support their work. A strong
literature base supports all the work that the OSHW's L GBTQ+ and Sexual
Health T eam is doing to support schools, these are just two examples.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
Sexual Health Education Focus Groups: 
A qualitativ e approach will be used to address the following ev aluation
questions that are proposed b y OSHW and the P3RC ev aluation team: 1)
What are the experiences of SHE teachers implementing the new SHE
curricula? 2) Is it appropriate, accessible, feasible, and what are their
perceptions of its impact on student engagement and learning? F our focus
groups with sexual health education instructors who deliv ered CPS’ s sexual
health education curriculum to Pre-K, 2nd gr ade, 4th gr ade, and/or 5th
grade students will be held to obtain participants’ experience deliv ering SHE
lessons. One focus group , containing 6-10 participants, will be held with
instructors who teach each respectiv e grade. A total of 24-40 SHE
instructors will be participating in focus groups. SHE instructors that teach
Pre-K, 2nd gr ade, 4th gr ade, and/or 5th gr ade students will be identified
during the recruitment process via online sign-up form.
Summit Survey Analysis:
We have previously submitted the GS A Summit ev aluation for appro val with
the CPS RRB and receiv ed appro val. This w as previously submitted as an
amendment in March of 2022. This included that post surv eys to assess
satisfaction and learning would be conducted with both staff and students
following the district -led annual GS A Summit one da y event. A t this time we
are expanding this ev aluation effort to include pre, post, and follow -up
surveys. F or the purpose of linking the data across these time points we are
now proposing that CPS will collect the data using their own platforms, link
the responses, and use a code not link ed to an y identifiers to link them. This
de-identified data will then be shared with UIC for the purposes of analysis.
Sexual Health Services Condom Availability Program Follow-up
Interviews:
We have previously submitted the Condom A vailabilit y Progr am surv ey for
appro val with the CPS RRB , and receiv ed appro val. This w as previously
submitted as an amendment in March of 2023. This included that the
Condom A vailabilit y Progr am surv ey was to assess if schools had
implemented the progr am, logistics, and challenges. A t this time, we are
looking to expand this ev aluation to include interviews on schools who are
not implementing the progr am and don't plan to , and schools who
successfully na vigated through parent pushback and challenges, to answer
the question: How do SHS designees understand their role? What are the
specific challenges, barriers, facilitators to implementation and what
additional support and resources are needed in schools who are not
implementing the progr am?  What are the str ategies of those who ha ve
successfully address parent questions/concerns?  
 
Gender Inclusivity Professional Learning Community (PLC)
Evaluation
CPS OSHW and O TL is dev eloping and conducting a Professional Learning
Communit y (PLC) focused on Gender Inclusivit y that is designed to build
initiativ e school staff members’ capacit y to implement district science
curricula in a w ay that is inclusiv e of all gender identities. There will be
monthly meetings throughout the school y ear during which participants will
be able to share str ategies, troubleshoot challenges, and share lessons
learned in their implementation of curricula in gender inclusiv e ways.
Interviews will be conducted at the end of the school y ear to assess o verall
learnings, reflections, and recommendations from participants. P articipants
will be ask ed to participate in an interview that will tak e no more than 45-60
minutes, virtually on Z oom using the UIC platform, at a time con venient for
that individual, so that it will not conflict with the individual’ s work
responsibilities. Notes and recordings for the interviews will be collected.
 
Sexual Health Education Instructor Training Evaluation 
OSHW and the P3RC ev aluation team will conduct semi-structured k ey
informant interviews with SHE instructors who ha ve taken the SHE tr aining
during the SY22-23 school y ear. The interviews will be used to answer the
following ev aluation questions: “What are the learning, skill dev elopment,
and implementation outcomes of the SHE instructor tr aining?” “How are new
aspects of the updated SHE policy being implemented?” and “How is SHE
being implemented with div erse learners?” During SHE instructor tr ainings,
OSHW will ask participants if they are interested in participating in follow -up
interviews. OSHW will pro vide UIC/P3RC personnel with a list of participants
who identified interest, including information such as whether the individual
teaches at an elementary or high school, geogr aphic location of the school,
whether they are a Special Education teacher , and lastly whether they are a
new SHE instructor . This information will be used to ensure that a div erse
group of participants are selected to represent the div ersity of the school
district, as well as to identif y teachers who will teach sexual health education
to div erse learners. UIC/P3RC personnel will follow up with tr aining
participants who identified interest in participating in interviews during late
Spring once most teachers ha ve begun or ha ve finished implementing sexual
health education. Interviews will be conducted at the beginning of Spring
2023 to obtain their o verall feedback and experience of the SHE instructor
training and implementing sexual health education in their school. In
addition, instructors’ perspectiv es on whether and how the SHE instructor
training helped facilitate the implementation of sexual health education in
their school and classroom and other factors that helped promote or hinder
the implementation of sexual health education in their school and classroom
will be obtained during the interviews. P articipants will be ask ed to
participate in a 45–60-minute interview held virtually on a video
conferencing platform, such as Z oom using the UIC platform, at a time
convenient for that individual. P articipants will be ask ed to select aconvenient time for them so that it will not conflict with their work
responsibilities. Notes and recordings of the interviews will be collected.
 
 
Sexual Health Education Exemplar High School Case Study
UIC/P3RC ev aluation team will conduct semi-structured k ey informant
interviews with Principals/AP and SHE instructors to answer the following
evaluation question “What are the pr actices that facilitate high schools’
ability to implement SHE in gr ades 10-12?” 3-4 high schools will be recruited
for interviews, and 1-2 staff members from each school will be interviewed.
Mainly principals or assistant principals and SHE instructors at high schools
will be recruited for participation. OSHW will pro vide UIC/P3RC personnel
with a list of high schools using their Health y CPS Surv ey data, that ha ve
implemented sexual health education for 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th gr ade.
UIC/P3RC personnel will send principals/AP a recruitment email explaining
the purposes of the interviews, and to ask their permission to interview
them & other staff members in the school in volved in the implementation of
sexual health education at their school. If they agree, recruitment emails will
be sent to SHE instructors at their school. Interviews will be conducted at
the beginning of Spring 2023 to understand their experience and
perspectiv es around implementing sexual health education at their school.
Participants will be ask ed to participate in a 45–60-minute interview held
virtually on a video conferencing platform, such on Z oom using the UIC
platform, at a time con venient for that individual. P articipants will be ask ed
to select a con venient time for them so that it will not conflict with their
work responsibilities. Notes and recordings of the interviews will be
collected.
CAP Survey
The Office of Student Health and W ellness will be distributing the surv ey to
the staff member at each CPS school who has been designated as the
""Sexual Health Services"" designee for their school during the SY2022-2023
school y ear. The surv ey questions will ask about the logistics of the Condom
Availabilit y Progr am, the barriers and successes since the implementation of
the progr am, and what specific supports are needed at the school. The
survey link will be distributed via email to the SHS designee at each school.
The participants will be ask ed to participate in a 10-minute surv ey on a UIC -
based surv ey platform at a con venient time for the individual.
Coaches Interviews
P3RC team will be conducting interviews with coaches who participated in a
PD to learn about how to better support L GBTQ+ student athletes to gather
information regarding perceiv ed benefits of the tr aining, an y need for
impro vements, and recommendations to impro ve the PD . These will be
conducted 6 month following the No vember 8th tr aining conducted jointly b y
OSHW and OSP . Participants will be ask ed to participation in an interview
that will tak e no more than 45-60 minutes, virtually on Z oom using the UIC
platform, at a time con venient for that individual, so that it will not conflict
with the individual’ s work responsibilities. Notes and recordings for theinterviews will be collected.
Mentee Interviews
P3RC team will be conducting interviews with GS ALC Mentees to gather
information regarding str ategies, need for impro vements, and benefits
receiv ed from ha ving mentees. These will be conducted at the end of the
school y ear to understand how the mentee process went and what resources
are needed to impro ve the system. Interviews will be conducted at the end
of the school y ear to assess o verall learnings, reflections, and
recommendations from participants. P articipants will be ask ed to
participation in an interview that will tak e no more than 45-60 minutes,
virtually on Z oom using the UIC platform, at a time con venient for that
individual, so that it will not conflict with the individual’ s work
responsibilities. Notes and recordings for the interviews will be collected.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
Data from the interviews/focus groups will be thematically analyz ed using
MaxQDA softw are. A co-in vestigator and/or R esearch Assistant tr ained in
qualitativ e analysis will independently code 2 tr anscripts in MaxQDA using an
initial codebook. An iter ative process will be used to edit problematic codes
and refine coding definitions and/or inclusion/ex clusion criteria. T o facilitate
this process, memos (in MaxQDA softw are) will be used in cases where
coders feel more explanation is w arranted and/or to pro vide context not
otherwise deduced from the codes alone. Next, the coders will each code 1
new tr anscript to determine o verall doing agreement ar ates using the ‘final’
codebook. The researchers will go ahead and code the remaining tr anscripts
only after at least an 80% lev el of agreement is achiev ed. Coders will meet
regularly throughout coding and analysis to discuss emerging codes and
thematic dev elopment. Using the explor atory functions in MaxQDA, the
researchers will be able to identif y preliminary themes emerging from the
discussion group data. Findings will be segregated into two categories: 1)
formativ e findings, which will be used to inform the dev elopment of the
initiativ e and 2) baseline findings, which will be used to establish pre-
initiativ e understandings, pr actices, and experiences and used for later
comparison in the process ev aluation.
Data from the surv eys will be analyz ed by the R esearch Assistant and/or co-
investigator . The quantitativ e analysis will focus on the frequency of the
response choices, and the researchers will analyz e open-response questions
by emerging themes. The findings will be segregated into the following
categories: 1) Findings to inform what are the current barriers and what
technical assistance and supports are needed to address the barriers, 2)
what are the best pr actices and successes for implementing and sustaining
condom a vailabilit y progr am, 3) baseline findings, which will be used to
establish the pr actices and experiences, and later used for comparison in the
process ev aluation. 
Summit surv ey analysis of all pre/post/follow -up surv ey data, will include
univariate and biv ariate descriptiv e frequencies and measures of centr al
tendency . Findings ma y be reported b y demogr aphic group , where
applicable. Howev er, the case of small cell siz es for certain
racial/demogr aphic groups, these data will not be reported. Staff pre, post,
and follow -up data will be link ed and paired t -tests will be conducted for
linked responses. Student data will not be link ed and therefore pooled t -
tetsts will be conducted to assess change o ver time."

subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Linguistic div ersity in U .S. schools has increased due to the arriv al of
immigr ants and refugees from around the world. Nearly 10% of the U .S. K-
12 student population speak English as a second or third language and are
still dev eloping English proficiency (National Center for Education Statistics
[NCES], 2017). While 77% of English learners (ELs) speak Spanish as their
first language (L1), increasingly more ELs speak other languages than
Spanish, such as Ar abic, Chinese, Vietnamese, Hmong, and Somali. These
changes ha ve led to linguistically superdiv erse classroom contexts (Creese &
Blackledge, 2015), in which students speak multiple non-English languages
with v arying lev els of proficiency in English, L1, and content area liter acy.
U.S. schools face an urgent need to support all ELs as they become
independent members of a 21st century workforce while lev eraging their rich
and div erse cultur al and linguistic resources and guide teachers in doing so
(Suárez -Oroz co, 2001).
 
Research on science education for ELs has recommended sev eral effectiv e
teaching approaches, such as building on students’ div erse and rich
resources, engaging students in authentic science learning pr actices, and
encour aging and v aluing flexible use of multiple languages (Bruna & Gomez,
2009; Lee, 2002; S wanson, Bianchini, & Lee, 2014; W arren, Ballenger ,
Ogonowski, R oseberry , & Hudicourt -Barnes, 2001). Howev er, most research
has focused on teaching speak ers of Spanish in elementary and middle
school lev el science classrooms in which a majorit y of ELs speak the same
language (for ex ceptions, see Domínguez, Allexsaht -Snider , & Latimer , 2017;
Roseberry , Ogonowski, DiSchino , & W arren, 2010; Upadh yay, 2009).
Furthermore, while man y professional dev elopment (PD) progr ams
supporting science education for ELs pro vide a short -term workshop with
newly designed curriculum and curriculum guide, there is a lack of PD
models that engage teachers in a sustained communit y of pr actice through
collabor ation between researchers and teachers (Oliv eira & W einburgh,
2017).
 
To fill this gap in the liter ature and pr actices, the proposed project,
Professional dev elopment for K -12 science teachers in linguistically div erse
classrooms, will engage science and English as a New Language (ENL)
teachers in a sustained professional dev elopment (PD) progr am embedded
within their ev eryday classes, designed for a linguistically superdiv erse
group of ELs. This project is expected to aid teachers in tr ansforming their
teaching materials and instructional pr actices to foster science learning of
ELs. W e will dr aw on research-based science teaching pr actices that foster
linguistic minorit y students’ learning of science and in-service teacher PD
practices that ensure teachers’ sustained growth and instructional
transformation. An inno vation in this project is to pro vide collabor ationopportunities between the science and ENL departments, as such
collabor ation is often scarce or superficial, despite frequent
recommendations from the research liter ature (National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018).","to Date
- Online PD workshop (F all 2020- Spring 2021)
- Hybrid Lesson Study (F all 2021- Spring 2022)
- Summer PD workshop (Summer 2022)
- Collecting research data (video-recordings of Lesson Study meetings and
interviews of teachers and admin)Preliminary Results to Date
First, from the analysis of interview data from participating teachers, we
found that all science teachers at our partner school (Sulliv an) are
multilingual and grew up in multilingual and multicultur al environments.
Although these teachers’ languages (P olish, Greek, Albanian, Spanish,
French) do not necessarily o verlap with the languages that their students
are familiar with (Spanish, languages of Southeast Asian countries and
African countries), we found that these teachers could dr aw on their
linguistic knowledge, multilingual experiences, and disposition tow ard
linguistic and r acial div ersity. We dev eloped a conference proposal around
these findings for AERA 2022 although it w as not accepted for presentation.
Second, we ha ve analyz ed video-recordings from teacher PD workshops. In
this analysis, we focus on how teachers conceptualiz e relev ance in the
context of making modifications to the curriculum. Our preliminary findings
show that teachers desired to revise the curriculum to incorpor ate more
instructional scaffolds for class activities, dr aw on students’ daily
experiences outside of school, include analysis of publicly a vailable data
related to anchoring phenomena, and tak e actions to impro ve communit y as
an outcome of teaching. W e dev eloped and submitted a conference proposal
for American Educational R esearch Association, which is still under review .
Finally , participating teachers and research team collabor atively dev eloped a
presentation and presented at National Science T eachers Association. The
presentation focuses on the process of Japanese Lesson Study model and
learning that we gained through this work. W e shared insights into how to
engage emergent multilingual students in science sense-making, emplo ying
multimodalities, and challenging tak en-for -granted notions of engagement.

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
This NSF-funded project aims to refine our understanding of:
the key elements of instructional materials and teaching pr actices
that support English Learners (ELs) in linguistically ‘superdiv erse’ high
school science classrooms
the w ays in which teachers in linguistically superdiv erse high schools
learn to adopt these pr actices and materials
the impacts of a professional dev elopment progr am on ELs’
classroom participation and science learning
The project includes a (non-research) professional dev elopment progr am
and a research study .
The study will enroll a maximum of:
700 Sulliv an High School students (enrolled in science classes)
20 teachers (in science, ESL or other subjects)
10 School/District Administr ators/staff (e.g. Principals, district ESL
staff)
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
1. What are k ey elements of teaching materials and instructional pr actices
that support ELs’ learning in superdiv erse science classroom settings?
 
2. How do teachers in linguistically superdiv erse high schools learn to adopt
these pr actices and materials?
3. What are the impacts of the inno vative PD model on students’
participation and learning?Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Linguistic div ersity in U .S. schools has increased due to the arriv al of
immigr ants and refugees from around the world. Nearly 10% of the U .S. K-
12 student population speak English as a second or third language and are
still dev eloping English proficiency (National Center for Education Statistics
[NCES], 2017). While 77% of English learners (ELs) speak Spanish as their
first language (L1), increasingly more ELs speak other languages than
Spanish, such as Ar abic, Chinese, Vietnamese, Hmong, and Somali. These
changes ha ve led to linguistically superdiv erse classroom contexts (Creese &
Blackledge, 2015), in which students speak multiple non-English languages
with v arying lev els of proficiency in English, L1, and content area liter acy.
U.S. schools face an urgent need to support all ELs as they become
independent members of a 21st century workforce while lev eraging their rich
and div erse cultur al and linguistic resources and guide teachers in doing so
(Suárez -Oroz co, 2001).
 
Research on science education for ELs has recommended sev eral effectiv e
teaching approaches, such as building on students’ div erse and rich
resources, engaging students in authentic science learning pr actices, and
encour aging and v aluing flexible use of multiple languages (Bruna & Gomez,
2009; Lee, 2002; S wanson, Bianchini, & Lee, 2014; W arren, Ballenger ,
Ogonowski, R oseberry , & Hudicourt -Barnes, 2001). Howev er, most research
has focused on teaching speak ers of Spanish in elementary and middle
school lev el science classrooms in which a majorit y of ELs speak the same
language (for ex ceptions, see Domínguez, Allexsaht -Snider , & Latimer , 2017;
Roseberry , Ogonowski, DiSchino , & W arren, 2010; Upadh yay, 2009).
Furthermore, while man y professional dev elopment (PD) progr ams
supporting science education for ELs pro vide a short -term workshop with
newly designed curriculum and curriculum guide, there is a lack of PD
models that engage teachers in a sustained communit y of pr actice through
collabor ation between researchers and teachers (Oliv eira & W einburgh,
2017).
 
To fill this gap in the liter ature and pr actices, the proposed project,
Professional dev elopment for K -12 science teachers in linguistically div erse
classrooms, will engage science and English as a New Language (ENL)
teachers in a sustained professional dev elopment (PD) progr am embedded
within their ev eryday classes, designed for a linguistically superdiv erse
group of ELs. This project is expected to aid teachers in tr ansforming their
teaching materials and instructional pr actices to foster science learning of
ELs. W e will dr aw on research-based science teaching pr actices that foster
linguistic minorit y students’ learning of science and in-service teacher PD
practices that ensure teachers’ sustained growth and instructional
transformation. An inno vation in this project is to pro vide collabor ationopportunities between the science and ENL departments, as such
collabor ation is often scarce or superficial, despite frequent
recommendations from the research liter ature (National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018).Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement

Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
Videorecordings: Videorecordings of the PD progr am in Phases 1 and 2 will
be used to address R esearch Questions 1, 2 and 3. W e draw on approaches
from (mediated) discourse analysis (Bucholtz & Hall, 2005; K elly & Cr awford,
1997; Jones & Norris, 2005; W ortham & R eyes, 2015), ethnogr aphy
(Gordon, Holland, & Lahelma, 2001; Holland, Skinner , Lachicotte, Jr ., & Cain,
1998), and video analysis (Derry et al. , 2010). The research team will: 1)
watch the videorecordings in their entiret y, 2) select k ey ev ents from video
recordings that pro vide insights into each research question, 3) write
analytic notes for the selected ev ents, and 4) create a matrix that
documents selected ev ents, themes gener ated from the analysis, and target
research questions that each episode can potentially answer .
Interviews: W e will use interview data to address research question 1, and
supplement analysis of video recordings to address research question 2 and
3. Interviews will be tr anscribed and coded. W e will listen to , transcribe, and
code audio- recorded interviews for emerging themes. W e will create a
matrix that maps selected segments of interviews, themes gener ated from
the analysis, and target research questions.                       
Digital images of artifacts: Artifacts (e.g. lesson plans and teacher reflection
journal in Phase 1 & 2; student work in Phase 2) that are produced b y
participants during the ethnogr aphic period and the PD progr am will be used
to supplement the analysis of video recordings to address research
questions 1, 2 and 3. W e will gener ate themes to code segments of artifacts
(as described abo ve) and create a matrix to map selected segments of
artifacts, themes gener ated from the analysis, and target research
questions. During the pandemic and online PD activities, the artifacts will be
shared using secured Bo x folder . The participating teachers will upload their
artifacts to a shared Bo x folder , so that the research team can ha ve access
to them."

The project will in volve students and teachers participating in interviews with
a trained researcher . The interviews will be centered on identit y where
participants will be ask ed to discuss two o verarching topics: 1) Their
experience and understanding of their social identities and r acial
backgrounds and 2) their experiences in school talking about identit y. The
specific questions will be created in collabor ation with school partners (e.g. ,
teachers, administr ators, students), though an example protocol is pro vided
in the appendix. The interviews will be conducted in person at P eirce during
the school da y in a safe and confidential location designated b y the school
administr ators.
Only teachers who consent, as well as students who assent and whose
parents giv e consent to participate, will be interviewed. P otential participants
(e.g., teachers, students and parents) will be sent a fly er, which will detail
the information for the interviews including the topics that will be discussed,
the amount of time expected to conduct the interviews, and that each
interview will be conducted b y a tr ained researcher . All fly ers will be
distributed b y Peirce staff via email directly to parents and their children who
attend P eirce. The fly er also contains a notice that participation is v oluntary
and that there are no penalties for deciding not to participate. The electronic
flyer will also ha ve a link to consent and assent forms for parents and their
children to complete should they w ant to participate. The consent and assent
forms will be signed via Qualtrics. Both parents and children must sign. The
consent and assent forms can be found in the Appendix below . Physical
copies of consent and assent forms will be sent home with students and
distributed before and after school.
We expect to recruit and conduct individual interviews with teachers as well

current information, this would mean a maximum of 10 teachers and 45
students.","Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of

the identities and motiv ation of 7th and 8th-gr ade students. Our results,
which ha ve been shared with the school, show initial support for the success
of the progr am. Subsequently , we conducted focus groups with students,
staff, and communit y members on issues of r ace and identit y. Initial findings
were shared with the school communit y and are being used to further the
aims of the school's impro vement goals. One of those goals w as to support
the dev elopment and ev aluation of r acial affinit y groups. This support began
in 2023 through the facilitation of a pilot affinit y group . The insights from
this were used to expand the groups for the larger school communit y. In
2024, we continued to ev aluate and support r acial affinit y groups at both
schools, while also interviewing white students at P eirce to better
understand w ays to in volve white students in school r acial equit y initiativ es
and impro ve school motiv ation and belonging.
 
This modification will continue to support the schools’ r acial equit y goals b y

race impact students’ identit y and the broader school en vironment. W e plan
to measure students’ outcomes longitudinally o ver the course of their

teachers and students. The insights from the affinit y group , racial equit y
interviews, and the needs of the school demonstr ated this path as an
important next step in pursuing the school’ s goals for r acial equit y broadly .

How do teachers talk about r ace and identit y in the classroom?
 
How do con versations around r ace and identit y in the school curriculum
shape students’ a wareness and school experience?","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The project aims contributes to a growing body of research on theory -based
social psy chological interv entions to address disparities in academic
outcomes. F or example, Cohen and colleagues (2009) found that a brief
values affirmation interv ention aiming to counter act stereot ype threat (see
Steele, 1997) significantly reduced the gap in academic achiev ement
between European American and African American students during middle
school. In another interv ention study , seventh gr ade students who were
encour aged to believ e that intelligence is malleable, r ather than fix ed,
subsequently earned higher gr ades at the end of the school y ear (Blackwell,
Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007). In the most relev ant example, Oyserman and
colleagues (2006) took an identit y-based approach, which focused on the
way that students thought about who they are and who they w ant to
become, also known as their possible selv es. A ten-session progr am guided
participating students to dev elop meaningful ideas about the direction of
their liv es and the steps necessary to reach their desired future identities,
which led to positiv e effects on students’ gr ades.
 
A series of smaller scale field experiments related to future identities ha ve
focused more specifically on socioeconomic consider ations that ha ve a
particularly strong effect on motiv ation for students from families with fewer
financial resources. In one line of research, Destin and Oyserman (2009)
directly addressed how perceiv ed financial barriers can influence students’
future identities and school motiv ation. Low SES sev enth gr ade students
who were r andomly assigned to learn about need-based financial aid for
college subsequently showed greater school motiv ation than those who were
randomly assigned to control conditions. Furthermore, in related work, a
similar group of students who were r andomly assigned to learn about the
long-term financial benefits of college were subsequently more lik ely to
complete schoolwork than students who were r andomly assigned to
comparison conditions (Destin & Oyserman, 2010). Both of these lines of
research suggest that specific thoughts about possible financial challenges or
future financial rew ards ha ve a significant connection to the t ypes of liv es
that students from low SES backgrounds imagine for themselv es, which
affects school motiv ation. The proposed research aims to contribute to the
interv ention liter ature b y directly incorpor ating information about financial
aspects of education, which ma y resonate particularly strongly with low SES
students and help to combat socioeconomic disparities in achiev ement.
 
 
Finally , the proposed project pro vides an opportunit y to assess the v alidity of
a hypothesiz ed theory of action connecting workshop materials to
achiev ement and beha vioral outcomes. Dr awing from the theories ofpossible selv es and identit y-based motiv ation (Markus & Nurius, 1986;
Oyserman & Destin, 2010), the proposed workshop is designed to impro ve
school outcomes b y shaping students’ ideas about their possible and lik ely
futures (measured as college-bound identities and possible selv es), which in
turn can be dr awn upon as a source of academic persev erance and efficacy
(see Zimmerman, Bandur a, & Martinez -Pons, 1992) b y giving long-term
meaning to immediate school tasks.","to Date

View xForm - Research Review Board (RRB) SubmissionPreliminary Results to Date
In our work, we aim to produce rigorous evidence on the t ypes of
experiences and progr ams that effectiv ely support students with particular
attention tow ard inspiring students in their postsecondary plans and
promoting equit y. For instance, through an earlier project in partnership with
Helen C. P eirce School of International Studies and with Nicholas Senn High
School, we ha ve shown that fostering near -peer mentorship experiences
between middle school students and high school students that are focused
on postsecondary planning significantly impro ves student motiv ation with
implications for achiev ement during the tr ansition into high school. In the
next v ersion, we expanded our work related to postsecondary plans to
directly address issues of equit y and determine how the messages students
receiv e about the groups that they belong to can be shaped to support
positiv e academic tr ajectories. The project demonstr ated the effects of a
progr am designed to dr aw connections between students’ beliefs about their
social groups and their future aspir ations in order to support school
engagement.
Our most recent work rev ealed a number of important insights that ha ve
contributed to the next direction of the partnerships. F or example, we
learned about k ey experiences within peer inter actions that cue students
from div erse r acial backgrounds to feel a sense of belonging in school or not.
Further , we gained insight into the elements of peer support that help
students na vigate such experiences in w ays that strengthen their school
motiv ation. Finally , the affinit y groups rev ealed the importance of peer
support dynamics in mediating students’ belonging, motiv ation, and identit y
development in school, particularly for r acially minoritiz ed students. Our
interviews with white students also suggested the potential benefits of
engaging in discussions around r ace and identit y with all students (not only
racially minoritiz ed students). The current modification builds on and
extends this prior work.

Artifacts.docx Classroom ArtifactsPlease outline your protocol for individual interview activities,
describing when, where, duration, frequency, and with whom.
The project will in volve students and teachers participating in interviews with
a trained researcher . The interviews will be centered on identit y where
participants will be ask ed to discuss two o verarching topics: 1) Their
experience and understanding of their social identities and r acial
backgrounds and 2) their experiences in school talking about identit y. The
specific questions will be created in collabor ation with school partners (e.g. ,
teachers, administr ators, students), though an example protocol is pro vided
in the appendix. The interviews will be conducted in person at P eirce during
the school da y in a safe and confidential location designated b y the school
administr ators.
Only teachers who consent, as well as students who assent and whose
parents giv e consent to participate, will be interviewed. P otential participants
(e.g., teachers, students and parents) will be sent a fly er, which will detail
the information for the interviews including the topics that will be discussed,
the amount of time expected to conduct the interviews, and that each
interview will be conducted b y a tr ained researcher . All fly ers will be
distributed b y Peirce staff via email directly to parents and their children who
attend P eirce. The fly er also contains a notice that participation is v oluntary
and that there are no penalties for deciding not to participate. The electronic
flyer will also ha ve a link to consent and assent forms for parents and their
children to complete should they w ant to participate. The consent and assent
forms will be signed via Qualtrics. Both parents and children must sign. The
consent and assent forms can be found in the Appendix below . Physical
copies of consent and assent forms will be sent home with students and
distributed before and after school.
We expect to recruit and conduct individual interviews with teachers as well
as students from all r acial groups across 5th through 8th gr ade. Based on
current information, this would mean a maximum of 10 teachers and 45
students.
Does this involve video, audio, or photograph recording?
Yes
Please describe the protocol for audio/video recording
If participants pro vide consent and assent, we will confidentially pro vide a
structured space to discuss their own r acial backgrounds, the experiences of
race in school, and about current ev ents regarding r ace in the US . These
interviews will be audio-recorded so that the study team ma y later tr anscribe
the interview . Audio-recording is not mandatory to participation. If
participants do not agree to be audio-recorded, they can still participate. This
discussion will be led b y an adult who shares their r acial background.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
We will protect an ything participants sa y in the interview and all the data will
be kept in password-protected files online which are encrypted and protected

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The last modification of this project expanded the r acial affinit y progr am and
evaluation at P eirce School of International Studies. The projects are still
progressing successfully . We are proposing this modification to continue to
support the schools’ r acial equit y goals b y including con versations with
educators and students related to school affinit y groups and classroom
curriculum. This proposed modification builds on our previous work: In
2019-2020, we used funds from a North western - CPS R apid Impact Gr ant
to test the effects of a series of mentoring workshops designed to support
the identities and motiv ation of 7th and 8th-gr ade students. Our results,
which ha ve been shared with the school, show initial support for the success
of the progr am. Subsequently , we conducted focus groups with students,
staff, and communit y members on issues of r ace and identit y. Initial findings
were shared with the school communit y and are being used to further the
aims of the school's impro vement goals. One of those goals w as to support
the dev elopment and ev aluation of r acial affinit y groups. This support began
in 2023 through the facilitation of a pilot affinit y group . The insights from
this were used to expand the groups for the larger school communit y. In
2024, we continued to ev aluate and support r acial affinit y groups at both
schools, while also interviewing white students at P eirce to better
understand w ays to in volve white students in school r acial equit y initiativ es
and impro ve school motiv ation and belonging.
 
This modification will continue to support the schools’ r acial equit y goals b y
understanding how r acial affinit y groups and classroom curriculum related to
race impact students’ identit y and the broader school en vironment. W e plan
to measure students’ outcomes longitudinally o ver the course of their
academic y ear by observing classroom discussions and interviewing some
teachers and students. The insights from the affinit y group , racial equit y
interviews, and the needs of the school demonstr ated this path as an
important next step in pursuing the school’ s goals for r acial equit y broadly .
In consultation with school administr ators, members of the Local School
Council, and teachers, we are dev eloping a research-back ed curriculum that
will promote the identit y dev elopment of students and impro ve school
motiv ation and belonging.Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
 
What are the r acializ ed experiences of students, staff , and parents
experience in connection to the school communit y?
 
How do teachers talk about r ace and identit y in the classroom?
 
How do con versations around r ace and identit y in the school curriculum
shape students’ a wareness and school experience?
 Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The project aims contributes to a growing body of research on theory -based
social psy chological interv entions to address disparities in academic
outcomes. F or example, Cohen and colleagues (2009) found that a brief
values affirmation interv ention aiming to counter act stereot ype threat (see
Steele, 1997) significantly reduced the gap in academic achiev ement
between European American and African American students during middle
school. In another interv ention study , seventh gr ade students who were
encour aged to believ e that intelligence is malleable, r ather than fix ed,
subsequently earned higher gr ades at the end of the school y ear (Blackwell,
Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007). In the most relev ant example, Oyserman and
colleagues (2006) took an identit y-based approach, which focused on the
way that students thought about who they are and who they w ant to
become, also known as their possible selv es. A ten-session progr am guided
participating students to dev elop meaningful ideas about the direction of
their liv es and the steps necessary to reach their desired future identities,
which led to positiv e effects on students’ gr ades.
 
A series of smaller scale field experiments related to future identities ha ve
focused more specifically on socioeconomic consider ations that ha ve a
particularly strong effect on motiv ation for students from families with fewer
financial resources. In one line of research, Destin and Oyserman (2009)
directly addressed how perceiv ed financial barriers can influence students’
future identities and school motiv ation. Low SES sev enth gr ade students
who were r andomly assigned to learn about need-based financial aid for
college subsequently showed greater school motiv ation than those who were
randomly assigned to control conditions. Furthermore, in related work, a
similar group of students who were r andomly assigned to learn about the
long-term financial benefits of college were subsequently more lik ely to
complete schoolwork than students who were r andomly assigned to
comparison conditions (Destin & Oyserman, 2010). Both of these lines of
research suggest that specific thoughts about possible financial challenges or
future financial rew ards ha ve a significant connection to the t ypes of liv es
that students from low SES backgrounds imagine for themselv es, which
affects school motiv ation. The proposed research aims to contribute to the
interv ention liter ature b y directly incorpor ating information about financial
aspects of education, which ma y resonate particularly strongly with low SES
students and help to combat socioeconomic disparities in achiev ement.
 
 
Finally , the proposed project pro vides an opportunit y to assess the v alidity of
a hypothesiz ed theory of action connecting workshop materials to
achiev ement and beha vioral outcomes. Dr awing from the theories ofpossible selv es and identit y-based motiv ation (Markus & Nurius, 1986;
Oyserman & Destin, 2010), the proposed workshop is designed to impro ve
school outcomes b y shaping students’ ideas about their possible and lik ely
futures (measured as college-bound identities and possible selv es), which in
turn can be dr awn upon as a source of academic persev erance and efficacy
(see Zimmerman, Bandur a, & Martinez -Pons, 1992) b y giving long-term
meaning to immediate school tasks.
Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
The ev aluation of the r acial affinit y progr am and classroom curriculum will
be coordinated in consultation with school administr ators. School partners
will recruit co-facilitators and teachers to finaliz e the curriculum alongside
parent organiz ers. As research partners, we will contribute to the
organization and facilitation of both activities (e.g. , racial affinit y groups,
classroom curriculum related to r ace) as requested and dev elop the
evaluation. P articipating teachers and students will complete interviews
throughout the y ear (during, and after the affinit y groups and curriculum
implementation), and with appro val from school administr ators and
teachers, researchers from our team will observ e classroom discussions and
collect classroom artifacts. Further , to impro ve the accur acy of the findings,
we will recruit students who did not participate in these activities to act as a
“control” group to compare their outcomes with students who did participate
in these activities. This quasi-experimental approach will pro vide important
insights into the effect of these activities on students’ outcomes.
Additionally , after the progr am, we will conduct interviews with progr am
facilitators to understand their experiences in the progr am as well as their
interpretations of its impact on students’ experiences. W e will assess
whether the progr am effectiv ely dev eloped a safe, enjo yable, and
challenging space for participants. In addition, we will assess whether the
progr am facilitated positiv e identit y dev elopment. P ost-progr am interviews
will be conducted beginning two weeks after the conclusion of the progr am.
The protocol for the interviews, and the details of the progr am can be found
below in the appendix. The interviews will be conducted at P eirce during the
school da y in a safe and confidential location designated b y the school
administr ators.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
The research methodology is qualitativ e. We plan to measure students’
outcomes longitudinally o ver the course of their academic y ear by observing
classroom discussions, collecting classroom artifacts, and interviewing some
teachers and students. T o analyz e the qualitativ e data, we will use an
inductiv e approach to gener ate data-driv en codes and themes, following
Wolcott ’s (1994) three-lev el model of description (gener al landscape of the
data), analysis  (how do the observ ations fit together?), and interpretation
(what do these stories rev eal about the research question?). Our analysis
process will allow us to examine how students’ meaning making related to
race, identit y, and belonging are (or are not) shifting o ver the course of the
academic y ear."

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The o verarching goal of the BELE Network is to build and support the
capacit y of participating individuals and their district teams to lead for equit y
and pursue liber ating, resilient systems.  This is challenging, dynamic, and
essential work in the broader service of the y oung people, families, and
communities that our public schools serv e.  In addition, one intention of the
BELE project is to understand how adults learn, how they do their work,
what tools assist them, and how that knowledge is shared. 
The research that is being conducted alongside the network activities helps
to support the work of the National Equit y Project (NEP) coaches and
provides an important opportunit y to dev elop our collectiv e understanding of
how and under what conditions adults learn and build their capacit y together
for engaging in equit y-driven leadership .
District teams that are participating in the BELE District Network are
comprised of individuals from the district and can include: district leaders;
teachers; counselors; other school staff; and students.
This y ear in the BELE Network, Consortium researchers will be observing,
documenting, participating in, and supporting network activities throughout
its dur ation. The research will pro vide a record of the work that supports
NEP coaches and pro vides an important opportunit y to dev elop our collectiv e
understanding of how and under what conditions adults learn and build their
capacit y together for engaging in equit y-driven leadership and what do
adults need to learn and understand in order for all y oung people to grow
and learn and thriv e. In addition, Consortium researchers will interview
students who are participants in the BELE Network.  These interviews will
shed light on y outh learning and understanding of their experiences in
school and classrooms as well as their learning as participants in the BELE
Network. Similarly , adult participants in the BELE Network will share their
experience as being part of the BELE Network and how they use the BELE
experiences to impro ve their classrooms and schools and how the
application of an intentional equit y lens b y schools and organizations shapes
the dev elopment of learning experiences for both adults and students.
 
TFA interviews will shed light on adult learning and also v alidate an approach
to building adult capacit y and professional learning that can be scaled to
other similar organizations.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
1) What would schools and classrooms need to look lik e if the dev elopment
of young people’ s agency , integr ated identit y, and competencies became
primary aims of K -12 education? What kinds of school and classroom
structures, policies, and pr actices would best support these aims?
2) What kinds of experiences would children and y outh need to ha ve in K -12
classrooms to dev elop agency , integr ated identit y, and competencies and the
foundational components (self -regulation, knowledge & skills, learning
mindsets, and v alues) that support and enable them? What constitutes
“qualit y” in dev elopmental classroom experiences, and how might qualit y be
measured? How might schools and districts ensure that high-qualit y
developmental experiences are a vailable and accessible to all students and
serve to interrupt existing inequities in educational systems?
3) What are the implications of such a shift for teachers’ learning,
development, and professional pr actice? What experiences and opportunities
would teachers need, and districts can support, to equip them to create the
kinds of classrooms and intentional dev elopmental experiences that would
best support their students’ growth and learning?
4) What t ypes of Adult Learning experiences lead to successful and equitable
learning en vironments for students and how does the application of an
intentional equit y lens b y schools, districts, and organizations shape the
development of learning experiences for both adults and students.
Participants in the BELE Network will dev elop competencies that will enable
them to impact student agency , identit y, and belonging.  In addition,
through participation in the BELE network, students will be empowered to
use their v oice for activism and change.  Student v oice will be centered and
lead to changes in adult pr actice and student engagement.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Over the past sev eral years, the Consortium has been engaged in a series of
integr ated projects to better understand the role of noncognitiv e factors in
students’ school performance; teacher perceptions of their role in student
learning and dev elopment; the effect of school structures and policies on
teacher mindsets, teacher learning, and teacher pr actice; the measurement
of student mindsets, learning str ategies, persev erance, and academic
behaviors in classroom settings; the measurement of teacher beliefs and
experiences within school settings; and the relationship of teacher mindsets
to teacher pr actice and students’ experiences in classrooms. In 2015, the
Consortium produced a dev elopmental fr amework that identifies three k ey
factors – agency , integr ated identit y, and competencies – that equip y oung
adults to successfully engage in postsecondary education, work, family ,
relationships, health, and civil societ y. The F oundations for Y oung Adult
Success fr amework also identifies four foundational components (self -
regulation, knowledge & skills, mindsets, and v alues) that underlie these k ey
factors and delineates how and when these foundational components
develop from ages 3-20 across a v ariety of settings.
Furthermore, in the last few y ears, the National Commission on Social,
Emotional, and Academic Dev elopment (NCSEAD) Jones, S . M., & Kahn, J .
(2017) and the Science of Learning and Dev elopment initiativ e (SoLD)
Cantor , P., Osher , D., Berg, J ., Stey er, L., & Rose, T . (2018) ha ve been
building the evidence base that learning and dev elopment are alw ays
simultaneously social, emotional, and cognitiv e processes, directly facilitated
by human relationships. Children and y outh also ha ve individual learning
profiles and dev elopmental tr ajectories. High-qualit y early childhood
progr ams recogniz e these basic facts and are designed to support children’ s
holistic learning and dev elopment across all of these domains in the context
of warm and supportiv e relationships with their teachers and caregiv ers.
Howev er, as students mo ve into and through most K12 systems, they
experience learning settings that increasingly standardiz e instruction and
focus on academic knowledge while stripping a way supports for learners’
social and emotional engagement and dev elopment (Halpern, R. , Heckman,
P., & Larson, R. (2013).W e now know that this is a wrong-headed approach,
that learning is social and emotional at its core at ev ery age. Learning is
always embedded in larger contexts of relationships, purpose, meaning
making, and identit y. This is true regardless of student demogr aphics, lev el
of prior academic achiev ement, or a vailable resources in a school or
communit y. To best support student learning, educators need to understand
how complex issues of equit y and cultur ally relev ant education intersect with
basic tenets of child and adolescent dev elopment, learner v ariabilit y, and the
psychology of motiv ation and engagement.
To ensure that all learners build deep intellectual competence and expertise,
systems need to organiz e themselv es to ensure that ev ery da y, within ev ery
learning setting, ev ery child has strong, supportiv e, and sustained
relationships with adults and peers and dev elopmentally appropriateexperiences that build their understanding of themselv es and other people,
expand their capacit y to constructiv ely engage with peers and adults in their
immediate contexts and in the broader world, and that ultimately allow them
to realiz e their fullest potential as human beings. The education sector is
coming to realiz e that schools pla y a sizable role in shaping broader
outcomes bey ond academic achiev ement – with lifelong implications for
students, families, and communities – whether they do so intentionally or
not. The field needs guidance and opportunities to gr apple with how
educators and other adults tak e on that role purposefully and responsibly .
We recogniz e the important groundwork laid b y education reformers who
have dev eloped high standards for academic ex cellence for all students, and
we hold that as a shared v alue. W e also see impassioned communities
advocating for schools to work tow ard broader outcomes for all y oung

social work ers, communit y organiz ers, and others working on issues of
youth well-being and equit y in education, public health, communit y
organizing, civil rights, and the criminal justice and child welfare systems.
Despite the hard work and best intentions of the people working within
them, schools, school districts, and school networks systematically produce
inequitable outcomes for y oung people. When we fail to meet the academic
and dev elopmental needs of some students in a classroom or in a
communit y, all students suffer . As a field, we do not y et adequately prepare
and support educators, or design classrooms and schools, to reliably dr aw
upon the assets and dev elop the full potential of the div erse arr ay of
learners in our public schools. W e see ev ery da y the energy , passion, and
intelligence of adults working to pro vide tr ansformativ e educational
experiences to the students and families they serv e in schools and other
youth settings all around the country . Yet, despite the good intentions and
great work of so man y people, preK -12 public education systems still
overwhelmingly produce reliably dispar ate outcomes b y students’ r ace or
ethnicit y, socioeconomic status, language status, tr auma histories, learning
differences, or other category of social marginalization.
Young people’ s schooling experiences pro vide direct benefit to some, but
leave far too man y youth without the knowledge, skills, or critical
opportunities to become the whole, health y people they might otherwisebecome, or accomplish the great things they might otherwise do , were they
to have appropriate opportunities, support, and affirmation of their assets
and identities. As such, local communities systematically w aste an incredible
pool of human potential in each cohort of students, predominantly among
the children and families situated farthest from social and economic
opportunit y – though this is a problem not limited b y race, culture, or
socioeconomic class. T o date, efforts to address the issues laid out abo ve
(the re-integr ation of social, emotional, and academic learning; the div ersity
of learners and learning profiles; and the importance of broader student
outcomes) often neglect to attend directly to the issue of systemic inequit y.
There is growing recognition that our prev ailing SEL fr ameworks, constructs
and pr actices do not adequately address issues of educational equit y.
Further , there has been limited attention to and integr ation of adult learning
and dev elopment in this work.
We are all too familiar with the litan y of challenges facing public education:
Persistent disparities in educational outcomes b y race and socioeconomic
status. Inadequate teacher prepar ation and compensation. High lev els of
teacher turno ver and burnout. Low expectations for children with disabilities
or learning differences. Public disin vestment in schools and communities of
color. Testing and measuring with little impro vement. A robust school-to-
prison pipeline. Demonizing educators and pathologizing children and
families. Under -resourced teachers and school leaders trying to work
miracles without support. A constant churn of leadership , initiativ es,
curricula, and “magic bullets. ” A variety of stak eholders oper ating in silos
with little collabor ation or shared learning. And most recently , the challenges
of remote teaching and learning and the assault on equit y in our systems.
While these are daunting challenges, we believ e that none of these problems
is inevitable. Our challenges arise out of a set of policies, pr actices,
structures, and narr atives that we can change. Our collectiv e goal is to mo ve
the field from its current state to the realization of local preK12 public
education systems (supported b y other y outh-serving systems and
expanded learning opportunities) that reliably produce equitable outcomes
for all students. This requires a tr ansformational par adigm shift: eliminating
structur al barriers to existing opportunities to learning and dev elopment;
applying the best of scientific knowledge and pro ven pedagogies to create
new, more equitable opportunities; and creating a system of comprehensiv e
supports for the social, emotional, and academic dev elopment of all children
and y outh— and the adults who teach and mentor them.
To engage in this work, educators need vision, partnerships, and support.
We believ e that, collectiv ely in a Network, people working within education
can design systems that ensure that ev ery child is pro vided with the
opportunities, experiences, and nurturing relationships necessary to dev elop
to their full potential. This will only happen if we engage in the stories and
aspirations of our students and educators; work collabor atively across sector
and discipline to design new approaches; and tak e collectiv e action in
service of equitable learning experiences and outcomes at ev ery lev el: for
children, for teachers, for families, for school and system leaders.","to Date
Interviews with CA SEl coaches, NEP organiz ers, Cultiv ate for Coaches, TF A
interviewsPreliminary Results to Date
We have work ed to modif y and impro ve the Catalyz e surv ey.
Background
Catalyz e was designed as a self -report surv ey that assesses 6 constructs of
organizational conditions found in the academic liter ature to facilitate staff
organizational commitment and capacit y beliefs, commitment to change and
motiv ation, among other k ey enablers for organizational change. The
content of the surv ey was dev eloped b y Consortium researchers in
collabor ation with PER TS and with experts from CA SEL and the National
Equity Project who ha ve substantial knowledge and experience in supporting
schools and districts engaging in tr ansformativ e equit y initiativ es. Our
review included interviews with educators, factor analysis and con ventional
Rasch item analysis.
Based on the research these changes were made to the Catalyz e surv ey
1)The response scale will be changing from a 6-point, bipolar scale (Strongly
agree to Strongly disagree) to a 5-point, unipolar scale (Completely true to
Not at all true).
2)Some of the organizational conditions ha ve changed. While the six original
organizational conditions were selected based on a corpus of research
literature and insight from our expert partners, in pr actice they were not
distinct enough to consistently assist leaders in determining the specific
aspects of the organization most in need of attention.
3) Man y surv ey items will ha ve changed. While sev eral surv ey questions will
stay the same, man y will ha ve revised language to mak e them more precise.
You will also notice sev eral new (to Catalyz e) surv ey questions.
We also ha ve gained knowledge on adult pr actices and mindsets as they
relate to implementing and using student experience data tools. A document
based on these T ransfer able Insights is attached below .
Through the adult interviews and TF A work, we ha ve learned that time and
support, shared experiences and collabor ation around this work is critical to
adults implementing Cultiv ate and using student experience tools. In
addition, adult mindsets can and do shift when collabor ation and
opportunities for sharing are present for co-horts of teachers. Materials
prepared for TF A coaches are attached below .
Members of our RA team in collabor ation with NEP put out a learning brief
on their experience as Y outh Organiz ers in NEP and they drew on some of
the NEP organiz er interviews we did as part of this BELE work.Type of Request
We are requesting a Continuing R eview to continue data
analysis. In particular we are still analyzing TF A data we
collected. W e also would lik e to extend timeline in order to

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The o verarching goal of the BELE Network is to build and support the
capacit y of participating individuals and their district teams to lead for equit y
and pursue liber ating, resilient systems.  This is challenging, dynamic, and
essential work in the broader service of the y oung people, families, and
communities that our public schools serv e.  In addition, one intention of the
BELE project is to understand how adults learn, how they do their work,
what tools assist them, and how that knowledge is shared. 
The research that is being conducted alongside the network activities helps
to support the work of the National Equit y Project (NEP) coaches and
provides an important opportunit y to dev elop our collectiv e understanding of
how and under what conditions adults learn and build their capacit y together
for engaging in equit y-driven leadership .
District teams that are participating in the BELE District Network are
comprised of individuals from the district and can include: district leaders;
teachers; counselors; other school staff; and students.
This y ear in the BELE Network, Consortium researchers will be observing,
documenting, participating in, and supporting network activities throughout
its dur ation. The research will pro vide a record of the work that supports
NEP coaches and pro vides an important opportunit y to dev elop our collectiv e
understanding of how and under what conditions adults learn and build their
capacit y together for engaging in equit y-driven leadership and what do
adults need to learn and understand in order for all y oung people to grow
and learn and thriv e. In addition, Consortium researchers will interview
students who are participants in the BELE Network.  These interviews will
shed light on y outh learning and understanding of their experiences in
school and classrooms as well as their learning as participants in the BELE
Network. Similarly , adult participants in the BELE Network will share their
experience as being part of the BELE Network and how they use the BELE
experiences to impro ve their classrooms and schools and how the
application of an intentional equit y lens b y schools and organizations shapes
the dev elopment of learning experiences for both adults and students.
 
TFA interviews will shed light on adult learning and also v alidate an approach
to building adult capacit y and professional learning that can be scaled to
other similar organizations.
 Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
1) What would schools and classrooms need to look lik e if the dev elopment
of young people’ s agency , integr ated identit y, and competencies became
primary aims of K -12 education? What kinds of school and classroom
structures, policies, and pr actices would best support these aims?
2) What kinds of experiences would children and y outh need to ha ve in K -12
classrooms to dev elop agency , integr ated identit y, and competencies and the
foundational components (self -regulation, knowledge & skills, learning
mindsets, and v alues) that support and enable them? What constitutes
“qualit y” in dev elopmental classroom experiences, and how might qualit y be
measured? How might schools and districts ensure that high-qualit y
developmental experiences are a vailable and accessible to all students and
serve to interrupt existing inequities in educational systems?
3) What are the implications of such a shift for teachers’ learning,
development, and professional pr actice? What experiences and opportunities
would teachers need, and districts can support, to equip them to create the
kinds of classrooms and intentional dev elopmental experiences that would
best support their students’ growth and learning?
4) What t ypes of Adult Learning experiences lead to successful and equitable
learning en vironments for students and how does the application of an
intentional equit y lens b y schools, districts, and organizations shape the
development of learning experiences for both adults and students.
Participants in the BELE Network will dev elop competencies that will enable
them to impact student agency , identit y, and belonging.  In addition,
through participation in the BELE network, students will be empowered to
use their v oice for activism and change.  Student v oice will be centered and
lead to changes in adult pr actice and student engagement.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Over the past sev eral years, the Consortium has been engaged in a series of
integr ated projects to better understand the role of noncognitiv e factors in
students’ school performance; teacher perceptions of their role in student
learning and dev elopment; the effect of school structures and policies on
teacher mindsets, teacher learning, and teacher pr actice; the measurement
of student mindsets, learning str ategies, persev erance, and academic
behaviors in classroom settings; the measurement of teacher beliefs and
experiences within school settings; and the relationship of teacher mindsets
to teacher pr actice and students’ experiences in classrooms. In 2015, the
Consortium produced a dev elopmental fr amework that identifies three k ey
factors – agency , integr ated identit y, and competencies – that equip y oung
adults to successfully engage in postsecondary education, work, family ,
relationships, health, and civil societ y. The F oundations for Y oung Adult
Success fr amework also identifies four foundational components (self -
regulation, knowledge & skills, mindsets, and v alues) that underlie these k ey
factors and delineates how and when these foundational components
develop from ages 3-20 across a v ariety of settings.
Furthermore, in the last few y ears, the National Commission on Social,
Emotional, and Academic Dev elopment (NCSEAD) Jones, S . M., & Kahn, J .
(2017) and the Science of Learning and Dev elopment initiativ e (SoLD)
Cantor , P., Osher , D., Berg, J ., Stey er, L., & Rose, T . (2018) ha ve been
building the evidence base that learning and dev elopment are alw ays
simultaneously social, emotional, and cognitiv e processes, directly facilitated
by human relationships. Children and y outh also ha ve individual learning
profiles and dev elopmental tr ajectories. High-qualit y early childhood
progr ams recogniz e these basic facts and are designed to support children’ s
holistic learning and dev elopment across all of these domains in the context
of warm and supportiv e relationships with their teachers and caregiv ers.
Howev er, as students mo ve into and through most K12 systems, they
experience learning settings that increasingly standardiz e instruction and
focus on academic knowledge while stripping a way supports for learners’
social and emotional engagement and dev elopment (Halpern, R. , Heckman,
P., & Larson, R. (2013).W e now know that this is a wrong-headed approach,
that learning is social and emotional at its core at ev ery age. Learning is
always embedded in larger contexts of relationships, purpose, meaning
making, and identit y. This is true regardless of student demogr aphics, lev el
of prior academic achiev ement, or a vailable resources in a school or
communit y. To best support student learning, educators need to understand
how complex issues of equit y and cultur ally relev ant education intersect with
basic tenets of child and adolescent dev elopment, learner v ariabilit y, and the
psychology of motiv ation and engagement.
To ensure that all learners build deep intellectual competence and expertise,
systems need to organiz e themselv es to ensure that ev ery da y, within ev ery
learning setting, ev ery child has strong, supportiv e, and sustained
relationships with adults and peers and dev elopmentally appropriateexperiences that build their understanding of themselv es and other people,
expand their capacit y to constructiv ely engage with peers and adults in their
immediate contexts and in the broader world, and that ultimately allow them
to realiz e their fullest potential as human beings. The education sector is
coming to realiz e that schools pla y a sizable role in shaping broader

educators and other adults tak e on that role purposefully and responsibly .
We recogniz e the important groundwork laid b y education reformers who
have dev eloped high standards for academic ex cellence for all students, and
we hold that as a shared v alue. W e also see impassioned communities
advocating for schools to work tow ard broader outcomes for all y oung

social work ers, communit y organiz ers, and others working on issues of
youth well-being and equit y in education, public health, communit y
organizing, civil rights, and the criminal justice and child welfare systems.
Despite the hard work and best intentions of the people working within
them, schools, school districts, and school networks systematically produce
inequitable outcomes for y oung people. When we fail to meet the academic
and dev elopmental needs of some students in a classroom or in a
communit y, all students suffer . As a field, we do not y et adequately prepare
and support educators, or design classrooms and schools, to reliably dr aw
upon the assets and dev elop the full potential of the div erse arr ay of
learners in our public schools. W e see ev ery da y the energy , passion, and
intelligence of adults working to pro vide tr ansformativ e educational
experiences to the students and families they serv e in schools and other
youth settings all around the country . Yet, despite the good intentions and
great work of so man y people, preK -12 public education systems still
overwhelmingly produce reliably dispar ate outcomes b y students’ r ace or
ethnicit y, socioeconomic status, language status, tr auma histories, learning
differences, or other category of social marginalization.
Young people’ s schooling experiences pro vide direct benefit to some, but
leave far too man y youth without the knowledge, skills, or critical
opportunities to become the whole, health y people they might otherwisebecome, or accomplish the great things they might otherwise do , were they
to have appropriate opportunities, support, and affirmation of their assets
and identities. As such, local communities systematically w aste an incredible
pool of human potential in each cohort of students, predominantly among
the children and families situated farthest from social and economic
opportunit y – though this is a problem not limited b y race, culture, or
socioeconomic class. T o date, efforts to address the issues laid out abo ve
(the re-integr ation of social, emotional, and academic learning; the div ersity
of learners and learning profiles; and the importance of broader student
outcomes) often neglect to attend directly to the issue of systemic inequit y.
There is growing recognition that our prev ailing SEL fr ameworks, constructs
and pr actices do not adequately address issues of educational equit y.
Further , there has been limited attention to and integr ation of adult learning
and dev elopment in this work.
We are all too familiar with the litan y of challenges facing public education:
Persistent disparities in educational outcomes b y race and socioeconomic
status. Inadequate teacher prepar ation and compensation. High lev els of
teacher turno ver and burnout. Low expectations for children with disabilities
or learning differences. Public disin vestment in schools and communities of
color. Testing and measuring with little impro vement. A robust school-to-
prison pipeline. Demonizing educators and pathologizing children and
families. Under -resourced teachers and school leaders trying to work
miracles without support. A constant churn of leadership , initiativ es,
curricula, and “magic bullets. ” A variety of stak eholders oper ating in silos
with little collabor ation or shared learning. And most recently , the challenges
of remote teaching and learning and the assault on equit y in our systems.
While these are daunting challenges, we believ e that none of these problems
is inevitable. Our challenges arise out of a set of policies, pr actices,
structures, and narr atives that we can change. Our collectiv e goal is to mo ve
the field from its current state to the realization of local preK12 public
education systems (supported b y other y outh-serving systems and
expanded learning opportunities) that reliably produce equitable outcomes
for all students. This requires a tr ansformational par adigm shift: eliminating
structur al barriers to existing opportunities to learning and dev elopment;
applying the best of scientific knowledge and pro ven pedagogies to create
new, more equitable opportunities; and creating a system of comprehensiv e
supports for the social, emotional, and academic dev elopment of all children
and y outh— and the adults who teach and mentor them.
To engage in this work, educators need vision, partnerships, and support.
We believ e that, collectiv ely in a Network, people working within education
can design systems that ensure that ev ery child is pro vided with the
opportunities, experiences, and nurturing relationships necessary to dev elop
to their full potential. This will only happen if we engage in the stories and
aspirations of our students and educators; work collabor atively across sector
and discipline to design new approaches; and tak e collectiv e action in
service of equitable learning experiences and outcomes at ev ery lev el: for
children, for teachers, for families, for school and system leaders.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement

Practicing Democr acy in Communities initiativ e. This is a 5- year gr ant that seeks to
support classroom instructional pr actices in civic education, gener ate authentic civic

communities/communit y organizations and civic education classrooms. W e are
interested in ev aluating our progr am str ategies in order to pro vide better supports

educational experience for middle and high school students in Chicago and believ e
that robust civic education tak es place in classrooms and in communities. W e seek
to have a positiv e impact on teacher pedagogical pr actices and students

robust civic learning experiences, communit y collabor ation and connection - are
staffed b y a professional who works with our v arious stak eholder groups to gener ate
high qualit y learning experiences for CPS students. W e believ e that our approach
can lead to stronger student skills and dispositions for activ e democr atic
engagement and stronger pedagogical str ategies among civic education teachers.
This will in turn lead to stronger , more robust and engaged communities that work
together to liv e into the goals of a democr atic societ y. The dispositions we target for
students are communit y awareness, communit y engagement, collabor ation, civic
identit y, civic efficacy , and civic agency . The pedagogical pr actices that we
foreground in this project are critical inquiry , asset based communit y dev elopment,
engaging liv ed experience, and informed civic action.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.

What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build
upon the body of extant knowledge?
We draw on research liter ature from the fields of history of civic education,
curriculum and pedagogy , student identit y, and collabor ative teacher pr actices to
provide a foundation and r ationale for our work to strengthen civic education.
The founders of American democr acy understood that a centr al purpose of schooling
was to educate for democr acy. Washington argued that we must tend to the
development of the citiz en in order to “maintain the public good, [therefore] the
government of the United States had a common interest in citiz ens with good public
character” (Lowham & Lowham, 2015, p . 2). “Jefferson clearly understood that the
knowledge, skills, and beha viors of democr atic citiz enship do not just natur ally occur
in people. They must be taught consciously through schooling…. ” (Cogan, 1999, p .
52). Jefferson also argued that the goals of education should be to achiev e a
synthesis of republican and liber al ideals—to understand duties to neighbor and
country and to know and ex ercise basic rights. Fr anklin argued that civics should be
a cornerstone of public education and should be integr ated in all facets of the school
curriculum (P angle & P angle, 2000). All agreed that schools had a vital role in
preparing y oung people for activ e engagement in American democr acy. Further ,
each argued that democr atic habits are not innate; they must be taught, and they
must be learned. Humans are in fact hard- wired to think first of themselv es and the
interests of their tribes and perhaps secondarily the needs of others. But humans
have demonstr ated the capacit y to think and act bey ond their own narrow self -
interests (Bregman, 2019). Indeed, democr acy requires both the will to participate
along with a commitment to regard the needs of others in reaching tow ard solutions
to complex problems.
Howev er, we must consider the fact that man y schools and school districts are no
longer pro viding high qualit y instruction about our go vernment and civic institutions
and processes as a contributing factor to the discontent with our democr acy
(Alliance for R epresentativ e Democr acy, 2003; Bo yer, 1990; Cogan, 1999). Long a
mainsta y in American public schools, instruction in civics fell to the w ayside in the
1980’ s and, with few ex ceptions, continues to be the case (Carnegie Corpor ation of
America, 2011; K ahne & W estheimer , 2003). If our y oung people are not pro vided
high qualit y education to understand, access, and enact their systems of
governance, they will feel powerless and dissatisfied with our democr acy (R ubin,
2006).
Students in American public schools do not ha ve equitable access to civic learning
opportunities (K ahen & Middaugh, 2008; Levinson, 2012; R ubin, 2007). Until the
1980’ s, civics education w as a cornerstone in American public education. With the
advent of standards-based learning and assessment and a h yper focus on numer acy
and liter acy, social studies and in particular civic education took a significant hit. In
many states and school districts around the country , civics fell off the map
altogether . When we combine the fact that civics has been a scarce commodit y with
the realit y that what is present is inequitable, we ha ve a system that preferences
whiter , wealthier communities who already ha ve resources and power to engage
civically and politically .
As American societ y experiences deep partisan divides and ev en dissatisfaction with
the fundamentals of a democr atic societ y, education has a critical and existential
opportunit y to support the next gener ation of y oung people in the core principles of
democr acy that has sustained the country for almost 250 y ears. One fundamental
premise of Pr acticing Democr acy in Communities is that learning should be rooted instudent experience. Hammond (2015) argues that the human br ain is hard- wired for
learning b y making connections to pre-existing knowledge and experience.
Cultur ally responsiv e teaching (Ladson-Billings, 1996) argues from a sociological
perspectiv e that students of color will achiev e at high lev els when teaching and
learning is connected to student cultur al experience. Cohen, et al. (2018) offer a
compelling argument that qualit y, engaging civic education needs to connect the
lived racial, cultur al, and social experience of students with curriculum. A
fundamental need in urban education that scholars and researchers ha ve
compellingly identified and articulated is that the liv ed experience needs to be part
of the teaching and learning calculus in classrooms. The asset based communit y
development and critical civic engagement fr ameworks borrow hea vily from this
research and scholarship b y placing student experience at the center of learning.
Our conceptual foundation for action is rooted in asset -based communit y
development (ABCD) and our fr amework for civic learning is critical civic
engagement . ABCD grounds the work of a communit y in the principles of strengths-
based approaches, partnership dev elopment, and local self -determination. Our
pedagogical fr amework —critical civic engagement —has three fundamental
components: 1) engages the liv ed experience of students (Cohen, K ahne & Marshall,
2018); 2) dev elops and encour ages critical thought (Bermudez, 2014); and 3)
gener ates and supports informed civic action (Duncan- Andrade & Morrell, 2008;
Hipolito-Delgado & Zion, 2015; LeCompte & Blevins, 2015; Levinson, 2012). In
providing students with the ABCD foundation and the critical civic engagement
framework for instruction, we know that students dev elop a stronger sense of civic
identit y, which leads to lifelong civic engagement in our American democr acy
(Harrell-Levy , Kerpelman, & Henry , 2016; Hart, Richardson, & Wildenfeld, 2011;
Hauver, 2017; K ahne & Sporte, 2008; Martinez, P enaloza, & V alenzuela, 2012;
Porter, 2013; R ubin, 2007; R ubin, 2006; W atts & Flanagan, 2007; Y ouniss, 2011).
Erikson (1968) discussed the social challenges that each of us face as we grow and
mature. As we tr ansition into adolescence and y oung adulthood, we face the
challenge of identit y – our meaning and purpose in the world. W e translate this
transition as a civic identit y question. Y oung people who ha ve opportunities to
explore civic opportunities in their communities and in the world ha ve more
resources and experiences to dr aw from as they negotiate this stage of dev elopment
(Corcetti, Erentaite, Zukauskiene, 2014; Martinez, P enaloza, & V alenzuela, 2012; 
Porter, 2013; R ubin, 2007). Duncan- Andrade & Morrell (2008), Harrell-Levy ,
Kerpelman, & Henry (2016), Hauv er (2017), Hipolito-Delgado & Zion (2015),
Molina-Giron (2016), R ubin (2007), Y ouniss (2011) argue that school can be
effectiv e spaces to support civic learning experiences that build a stronger sense of
civic identit y.
Teachers in man y American public schools tend to be isolated from their peers both
internally and externally . The abilit y to collabor ate, network, learn together , and
share resources and insights is an important opportunit y to strengthen pr actices
that result in benefits for students. The PDC communities of pr actice str ategy brings
teachers together to strengthen pr actices in US History and civics education within a
specific communit y setting. T occi and R yan (2023) pro vide evidence that “horiz ontal
expertise” among teachers in these settings recogniz es the “unique knowledge and
understanding that each professional [brings] to the collectiv e activit y and treats the
knowledge as equally v aluable, relev ant, and important ” (p. 6). PDC will work to
level the pla ying field so that all students and all teachers bring experience, insights,
and expertise to a div erse and dynamic learning table. A placed-based system of
supports and engagement further enables teachers to pro vide authentic, inno vative,
high qualit y and meaningful instruction for students that is connected, holistic, and
supportiv e of all students.","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups,
observations, etc.)
We are proposing to administer two surv eys to students. These surv eys are
evaluativ e in nature and will help us understand if our resources, supports, and
practices are ha ving a positiv e impact on student dispositional growth. Both surv eys
will be a vailable online as google forms. The first surv ey will allow students to
evaluate their experience at a PDC external civic learning opportunit y. The surv ey is
a 13 question lik ert scale surv ey that students should able to complete in 5-10
minutes after an experience. Data from the surv ey will help us mak e adjustments to
our progr ams. The second surv ey is a 38-question retrospectiv e surv ey that asks
students to assess their own growth and dev elopment o ver the course of a civic
education class. The students will be ask ed to compare what they feel at the end of
a civic education class to what they felt at the beginning of the class. A retrospectiv e
survey tends to be a more effectiv e tool as often respondents r ate themselv es quite
high on a pre-progr am dispositional surv ey. When they respond at they end, they
may realiz e how much they ha ve learned and r ate themselv es highly once again,
therefore sk ewing the results. A retrospectiv e surv ey simply asks students to first
state how they feel about their own civic dispositions after the class and then
compare that with where they were when the started. This surv ey will help progr am
organiz ers to mak e adjustments to our progr am to focus more in areas that need
additional attention.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
To evaluate the influence of the PDC progr am on civic dispositions, we will emplo y a
retrospectiv e pretest posttest design. Students, whose teachers are participating in
the PDC communit y of pr actice professional dev elopment, will be ask ed to complete
an online Civic Disposition questionnaire to assess changes in student civic
dispositions at the end of their civics course. Demogr aphic information requested on
this questionnaire is limited to r ace/ethnicit y, gender identit y,  and school name.  No
identifiable information is collected.  School name is requested to allow for
disaggregation of results b y school.  T o evaluate student perceptions of Civic
Learning activit y experiences, we will emplo y a questionnaire which asks students to
indicate which learning activit y they engaged in and r ate their experiences with the
learning experience.  Demogr aphic information requested on the learning
experiences questionnaire is limited to r ace/ethnicit y, gender identit y,  and school
name.
 
Analysis of data will include percentages for r ace/ethnicit y, gender , and school,
descriptiv e statistics for disposition constructs, and t -test for retrospectiv e pre and
post test scores for each disposition construct.  Analysis of the disposition constructs
will also be disaggregated b y school to share with the PDC teachers for discussion in
their learning communit y. These results will be used to facilitate discussions among
PDC staff and the PDC teachers about the progr am’s influence and how the progr am
and pedagogy in civics can be impro ved or changed. Analysis, of learning
experiences questionnaire will consist of percentages r ating for each question.
Results will be presented b y which learning experiences students indicated they
participated in during their civics course."

We will administer assessments of students' math and reading achiev ement

Woodcock -Johnson IV Applied Problems, W oodcock -Johnson IV Math F acts
Fluency , Woodcock -Johnson IV Or al Comprehension) and assessments based
on the math tutoring curriculum (e.g. , Vanderbilt W ord Problems). W e will
also assess students' attitudes about math and reading at the beginning and

attitudes are related to their math learning and achiev ement. Therefore, we
want to examine whether the tutoring progr am impro ves students’ math
attitudes and whether students’ math attitudes are an important factor in
promoting and sustaining positiv e effects on math achiev ement. W e include
measures of both math and reading attitudes to see if the effects of the

Our proposed project centers on dev eloping a curriculum-based math

aim to ev aluate the utilit y of this college-based tutoring model. W e believ e
our research project can help address man y critical issues faced b y the
education sector toda y. One such issue is the need for cost -effectiv e,
scalable interv entions that impro ve students’ math achiev ement in early
elementary school. Man y math-based tutoring progr ams target middle and
high school students, missing a critical opportunit y to address achiev ement
gaps at their onset during early childhood. There is evidence that closing
achiev ement gaps early , before they are closely connected to negativ e
attitudes about math, holds promise for setting children on a positiv e
learning tr ajectory . Additionally , man y tutoring progr ams emplo y tutors or
fellows full-time, making the implementation of such progr ams costly for
schools and organizations. Our project aims to address these issues b y
evaluating the utilit y of a curriculum-based tutoring progr am that pro vides
additional mathematics support for elementary school children through the
utilization of college students as tutors. This model not only helps establish
partnerships between colleges and local K -12 school districts but also
provides college students with an enriching job opportunit y that can be
easily funded through go vernmental and nongo vernmental sources.
Evidence in support of this cost -effectiv e model could therefore rev olutioniz e

Relation [P oster Session]. Cognitiv e Dev elopment Societ y, Pasadena, CA.
Abstract: Students with lower math achiev ement gener ally experience
higher math anxiet y (Dowk er et al. , 2016; R amirez et al. , 2013). W e
examine whether this negativ e relation holds for students in “low
performing” schools where few students meet state math proficiency
standards. W e investigated this question in a study of 86 2nd gr ade
students, mainly from under -represented minorit y groups. As expected,
students at v ery low proficiency schools (0% of students proficient) had
lower math achiev ement than students at somewhat higher proficiency
schools (17-36% proficient) but math anxiet y did not differ b y school
context (T able 1). In a mix ed-effects model, School Math Proficiency and
Math Anxiet y x School Math Proficiency significantly predicted students’
math achiev ement (W oodcock -Johnson Applied Problems; T able 2). The
interaction reflected a nonsignificant relation for students in the moder ately
low proficiency schools and a marginal positiv e relation for students in the
very low proficiency schools (Figure 1). These findings suggest that the
math anxiet y-math achiev ement link differs in different school contexts,
possibly due to higher achieving students in low performing schools
experiencing greater achiev ement pressure compared to their lower
achieving peers, the rev erse of what ma y exist in higher performing schools.

Interviews
Questionnaire
Secondary Data R equestPlease outline your protocol for individual interview activities,
describing when, where, duration, frequency, and with whom.
We will administer assessments of students' math and reading achiev ement
before and after participation in the interv ention (math tutoring) or control
(reading enrichment). W e will use both standardiz ed assessments (e.g. ,
Woodcock -Johnson IV Applied Problems, W oodcock -Johnson IV Math F acts
Fluency , Woodcock -Johnson IV Or al Comprehension) and assessments based
on the math tutoring curriculum (e.g. , Vanderbilt W ord Problems). W e will
also assess students' attitudes about math and reading at the beginning and
end of the tutoring progr am. Prior research shows that students’ math
attitudes are related to their math learning and achiev ement. Therefore, we
want to examine whether the tutoring progr am impro ves students’ math
attitudes and whether students’ math attitudes are an important factor in
promoting and sustaining positiv e effects on math achiev ement. W e include
measures of both math and reading attitudes to see if the effects of the
tutoring progr am are specific to math or if the progr am has more gener al
effects on children’ s attitudes about learning. T rained research assistants will
administer all of the assessments. They will tak e place at the children's
school during the school da y or during the afterschool progr am based on the
needs of the schools. The administr ation will tak e place o ver 2-3 da ys for no
more than 30 minutes each da y. Examples of representativ e measures are
included as attachment. The team will select individual measures for list
based on time a vailable to conduct assessments at schools.

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
This project will dev elop a pre-established, evidence-based math tutoring
progr am that will pair tutors from local colleges and univ ersities with 2nd
grade students from neighboring elementary schools for after -school
tutoring. In the first y ear of the study , the tutoring progr am w as called
MathMatch T utoring. In the second y ear of the study , the tutoring progr am
will be called Learning Link Enrichment. Through the project, we aim to
evaluate the utilit y of this college-based tutoring model. W e will compare
children's math gains when participating in math tutoring with the gains of
children participating in an activ e reading control condition. The tutoring
progr am will use a pre-established tutoring curriculum called Pir ate Math
during the tutoring sessions as this curriculum has pro ven to be effectiv e at
increasing math achiev ement in early elementary school (Fuchs et al. , 2014;
Fuchs et al. , 2017; P owell et al. , 2020). W e hypothesiz e that: a) students
who receiv e math tutoring through our MathMatch/Learning Link progr am
will experience significantly greater gains in their math achiev ement, on
average, relativ e to students who participate in the reading control group .
Children in the control group will participate in liter acy enrichment activities
aligned with the Common Core Standards for Liter acy with their
undergr aduate tutor . This will primarily in volve shared book reading with the
tutor using dialogic reading str ategies to engage children's thinking about
the story . Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Through this research project, we aim to in vestigate the impact of receiving
math tutoring b y a college-student tutor using a scripted curriculum on
children's math achiev ement and math attitudes. W e hypothesiz e that
students who receiv e tutoring through our MathMatch/Learning Link
progr am will experience significantly higher math achiev ement at post -test,
on average, relativ e to students who participate in the activ e reading
control. 
Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Our proposed project centers on dev eloping a curriculum-based math
tutoring progr am that pairs undergr aduate students from local colleges and
universities with 2nd gr ade students from neighboring elementary schools
for after -school tutoring. Through this MathMatch/Learning Link project, we
aim to ev aluate the utilit y of this college-based tutoring model. W e believ e
our research project can help address man y critical issues faced b y the
education sector toda y. One such issue is the need for cost -effectiv e,
scalable interv entions that impro ve students’ math achiev ement in early
elementary school. Man y math-based tutoring progr ams target middle and
high school students, missing a critical opportunit y to address achiev ement
gaps at their onset during early childhood. There is evidence that closing
achiev ement gaps early , before they are closely connected to negativ e
attitudes about math, holds promise for setting children on a positiv e
learning tr ajectory . Additionally , man y tutoring progr ams emplo y tutors or
fellows full-time, making the implementation of such progr ams costly for
schools and organizations. Our project aims to address these issues b y
evaluating the utilit y of a curriculum-based tutoring progr am that pro vides
additional mathematics support for elementary school children through the
utilization of college students as tutors. This model not only helps establish
partnerships between colleges and local K -12 school districts but also
provides college students with an enriching job opportunit y that can be
easily funded through go vernmental and nongo vernmental sources.
Evidence in support of this cost -effectiv e model could therefore rev olutioniz e
and expand how tutoring is pro vided for students across the country .Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
In order to test whether math tutoring leads to significant gains in math
achiev ement, we will recruit a total of 50 2nd gr ade students from CPS
public schools and arr ange for a time and place after school (i.e. outside of
regular classroom instruction time) to pro vide math tutoring or liter acy
enrichment. The tutoring will occur o ver the course of 10 to 15 weeks, with
an additional 2-3 weeks used to collect measures of math attitudes and
math achiev ement before the start of tutoring and after the completion of
tutoring. Prior to the start, parent consent will be obtained for the child to
participate in the study . Trained undergr aduate tutors will work with their
assigned tutees two times a week after school. T utoring will occur at the
location of a partnering elementary school/after -school progr am. W e will use
data collected during tutoring implementation, such as student attendance,
the number of tutoring lessons completed, and measures of beha vior
management (e.g. , the number of checkmarks earned during tutoring that
earn them progress tow ard picking out a stick er as a priz e), as co variates in
our analyses. W e will explore if these factors moder ate tutoring
effectiv eness.  
During the fall semester , the elementary school children will be administered
pre-testing measures and post -testing measures will be obtained in the two
weeks following the end of tutoring. 2nd gr ade children will be ask ed for
assent before beginning the study . Before the first tutoring session,
researchers will inform the child that if they choose to participate, they will
be paired up with a tutor two times a week after school. W e will let them
know that the sessions are meant to be helpful and to just do their best.
Researchers will inform child participants their participation is v oluntary ,
they are free to skip , or withdr aw from the study whenev er they lik e, for an y
reason. They will also be informed that their performance in the session will
not ha ve any effect on their gr ades in school. Only those children who reply
in the affirmativ e will be tak en through the tasks. 
In implementing the tutoring progr am, we will communicate with parents
(via email, text, phone call, or letters home based on parents’ preference)
appro ximately twice a month during the progr am. The first communication
will notif y them of whether their child w as assigned to the math or reading
condition and subsequent communication will remind them of the tutoring
schedule and pro vide gener al updates on what children are working on
during tutoring. This communication will be brief and will not pro vide
feedback on their child. The purpose of this communication is to encour age
consistent progr am attendance and k eep parents informed.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
This study is a r andomiz ed control trial with two groups: the interv ention
group that will receiv e math tutoring and the control group that will receiv e
literacy enrichment."

Chicago Public Schools’ Office of Student Protections and Title IX (OSP) data
reveals disproportionate reporting of sexual misconduct across r acial/ethnic
groups of students. Howev er, Youth Risk Beha vior Surv eillance data for the
CPS student population rev eals no differences in bullying or sexual violence
among these groups. OSP is collabor ating with the study team at the
University of Illinois at Chicago to explore these reporting disparities and to
expand their capacit y to conduct this work.  In Phase 1 of the project, we
collected qualitativ e data from students, parents, and staff through focus
groups and k ey informant interviews. Ov erall objectiv es of Phase 1 of this
project were to determine students’ , CPS staff , and parents/caregiv ers’
current knowledge and understanding of CPS’ s Title IX R eporting tool and
reporting processes and perceptions of the factors influencing reporting, as
well as understand the str ategies being used to communicate to students
about the existence of the reporting tool and reporting processes. Phase 1
findings ha ve been used to inform the dev elopment of a surv ey that will be
administered to appro ximately 1200-1500 CPS high school students in Phase
2 of this project. Findings from the surv ey will be used to compare
perceptions and reported barriers and facilitators b y key CPS student
demogr aphic groups and most importantly to identif y recommendations to
ease reporting, e.g. policy changes, increased education, impro ved
messaging, etc. CPS OSP aims to use the study results to impro ve
communication about the policy and procedures to increase a wareness and
reduce barriers to student reporting.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
This ev aluation will explore the following aims: 1) What are the perceptions
of the reporting system and facilitators and barriers to reporting, among CPS
students?; 2) How do perceptions and reported barriers and facilitators v ary
by key CPS student demogr aphic groups?; and 3) What are
recommendations to ease reporting, e.g. policy changes, increased
education, impro ved messaging, etc.? It is h ypothesiz ed that the following
outcomes will be achiev ed during this project: 1) The identification of
common factors that influence reporting and 2) the dev elopment of a set of
actionable recommendations to impro ve communication about the policy and
procedures to increase a wareness and reduce barriers to student reporting.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
In the United States, sexual har assment and related occurrences among
middle and high school students are a relativ ely common occurrence.
Howev er, specific r ates of sexual har assment for this population v ary widely
across studies due to differences in definitions and study populations
(Mitchell, Ybarr a, & K orchmaros, 2014). R eports r ange from 10% - 80% of
adolescents experiencing sexual har assment, with differences b y gender ,
gender identit y, race, and sexual orientation (Fink elhor et al. , 2013; Lipson,
2001; Mitchell, Ybarr a, & K orchmaros, 2014; P etersen & Hy de, 2009).
Instances of sexual har assment can occur in-person or online and ma y be
perpetr ated b y peers or adults (i.e. , teachers or school staff ). These
incidents can ha ve negativ e beha vioral, emotional, educational, and health
consequences, the negativ e effects of which appear strongest for y oung
female students (Chiodo , et al. , 2009; Gruber & Finer an, 2007; Hand &
Sanchez, 2000). According to 2019 Y outh Risk Beha vior Surv eillance (YRBS)
data, in Chicago , appro ximately 1 in 10 students has reported being bullied
on school propert y and being electronically bullied (CDC, 2019). T welve
percent of y outh did not go to school due to feeling unsafe, and 13% ha ve
experienced sexual violence b y anyone in the past 12 months (CDC, 2019).
                CPS's Office of Student Protections and Title IX w as formally
launched in 2018 -created following a formal external review of all pr actices,
policies, and procedures for addressing sexual misconduct across the
district. The Office's mission is to ensure all students and staff are safe from
sex/gender discrimination, sexual har assment, and sexual violence and
misconduct at CPS . OSP has three units aligned with specific functions,
including In vestigations, Compliance and T raining, and a Coordination Unit.
The Coordination Unit is responsible for coordinating the district's response
to all reports of sexual misconduct affecting students. Students can mak e
reports through a newly -established comprehensiv e system that allows for
complaints to be reported online, via email, phone, or in-person—ensuring
that ev ery incident reported is fully addressed, resolv ed, and documented.
In addition to tr acking and following up incidents, OSP works collabor atively
across the district to tr ain staff , students, and families and creates,
develops, and implements prev ention progr amming for all students.
                OSP collects and reports incident data quarterly . Data currently
reveals disproportionate reporting across k ey racial/ethnic groups of
students.  R elativ e to the o verall CPS demogr aphics, Hispanic/Latinx and
White students are underrepresented while Black/African- American (AA)
students constitute the majorit y of complainants. YRBS data indicate no
significant differences in experiences of bullying or sexual violence among
Hispanic/Latinx, Black/AA, and White students (CDC, 2019). In addition to
asking about sexual violence more gener ally, YRBS asks students if they
have been forced to ha ve sexual intercourse in the past 12 months.
Black/AA and Hispanic/Latinx students both report ha ving had this
experience at significantly higher r ates than White students, y et not
significantly different from one another (CDC, 2019). Black/AA students andHispanic/Latinx students appear to experience similar har assment and
sexual misconduct r ates of all kinds. Y et, Hispanic/Latinx students, who
constitute 47% of the student population, are not making reports as
frequently as Black/AA students.
                While data on reporting beha viors of K -12 student populations is
limited, data from the college lev el indicates that a lack of knowledge of
anti-har assment policies, a lack of knowledge of how to mak e reports, and a
belief that reports will receiv e no response are common reporting barriers
(O'Connor et al. , 2017; W ozencroft et al. , 2015). There ma y be w ays in
which the messaging pro vided currently is not appropriately tailored to
specific groups. There are also lik ely structur al and systemic issues resulting
from centuries of r acism and discrimination that ma y influence the reporting
inequities. This project seeks to answer the following relev ant questions: 1)
Why are there different r ates in reporting beha viors of sexual har assment
and misconduct across CPS schools in the district, 2) how do , and to what
extent, do these barriers in reporting pla y a role in the disparities in
reporting beha viors of sexual har assment and misconduct across CPS
schools in the district, and 3) what opportunities are there to change policy ,
messaging, and current procedures to address these underlying inequities in
reporting among CPS schools in the district? A phased, mix ed-methods
approach will be emplo yed to address these questions and is currently
funded b y the Doris Duk e Foundation's R esearch 2 Action gr ant.","to Date
In our initial review we were appro ved to conduct qualitativ e interviews and
focus groups (project Phase 1). As of March 21, 2022 we ha ve concluded
this portion of the project and we ha ve completed a total of 8 interviews
with staff , 4 focus groups with students and 3 focus groups with parents.
Preliminary Results to Date
Preliminary qualitativ e findings rev eal that among students there is little
knowledge of the Office of Student Protections. Some students are a ware
they can report sexual misconduct to an adult at their school but few are
aware of online or anon ymous reporting opportunities made a vailable
through OSP . Staff , students, and parents reported a v ariety of barriers
students are lik ely face if they were to mak e a report. These include: 1)
Uncertaint y about what happens once students mak e a report; 2) W orry that
the process will tak e a long time to resolv e; 3) Concern about who else will
find out about what happened; 4) Concern about retaliation from other
students (e.g. gossip , continued conflict, etc.) or staff (e.g. gr ades, pla ying
time on an athletic team, etc.); 5) Concern about being called, or perceiv ed
as, a snitch; 6) Concern about serious consequences, such police
involvement; 7) F ear of parent/caregiv ers' reactions; and 8) Preferring to
resolv e the situation on their own. Finally , staff , students, and parents
reported suggestions and recommendations to ease reporting, including
impro ved and increased frequency of messaging about reporting
opportunities; increased tr ansparency of the reporting process, and more
opportunities for dialogue about health y relationships among students, staff ,
and parents.Type of Request

With this modification we are adding a student surv ey component as a
second phase of this project. Purposiv e sampling will be used to recruit 8-10
high schools in which 9th-12th gr ade students will be offered the opportunit y
to tak e the surv ey. UIC ev aluators will use our existing relationships with
CPS’s Office of Student Protections and member organizations within the
Project Advisory Committee to assist in selecting schools for recruitment with
an aim to ensure a mix of schools based on geogr aphy, demogr aphics, school
type, etc.
We will reach out to administr ators (i.e. , principals) of target schools and
explain the surv ey purpose and opportunit y. Prior experience indicates that
principal buy -in and their communication to teaching staff are k ey factors in
achieving a strong response r ate. In acknowledgement of the additional time
required to engage in the surv ey, the first 10 schools who agree to
participate will receiv e a stipend of $250 that can be used to support student
activities. W e anticipate 8-10 schools will participate in the surv ey with
student populations of between 100 and 500, with an a verage population of
300 students. Assuming a 50% response r ate, we anticipate a sample of
1,200 - 1,500 student respondents.
Principals of high schools in Networks 14, 15, 16, and 17 will receiv e emails
(see ""R2A_Phase2_School Surv ey Recruitment Script_v1_21Mar22"" for
specific email text) from an OSP Staff Member informing them of their
selection for the study and requesting their participation. An ev aluation team
member will mak e a follow -up email or phone call to answer an y questions
about the project.
If the principal agrees for their school to participate they will be ask ed to
assign a coordinator for the project (e.g. AP , PE/Health T eacher W ellness
Champions, etc.) and request time to for a 10-15 minute call to discuss
logistics for surv ey administr ation. During this 10-15 minute call they we willdiscuss all administr ation logistics with this staff point person (see
""R2A_Phase 2_Da y of Administr ation T oolkit_v1_21Mar22""). Those principals
from schools who do not respond after three attempts will be replaced with
another selected school with similar char acteristics (geogr aphy, school t ype,
etc.).
Please provide an overview of the proposed modifications to your
study methodology and/or research activities
The surv ey aims to assess perceptions of the reporting system and
facilitators and barriers to reporting, among CPS students. W e will also be
collecting demogr aphic information so as to facilitate a comparison of
perceptions and reported barriers and facilitators b y key CPS student
demogr aphic groups. This phase is informed b y the data we collected in
Phase 1 through which we conducted interviews with staff , focus groups with
parents, and focus groups with students. Phase 1 findings are attached here
in a power point slide deck that w as shared with OSP directors on F ebruary
24, 2022.
Please provide an overview of the proposed modifications to your
study consent forms or consent processes
Schools will be ask ed to send home the parents notification letter one week
prior to the planned surv ey administr ation, “R2A_Phase2_P arent
Notification_v1_21Mar22” . Schools will be reminded during the 10-15
minutes call with the coordinator that it is not necessary for parents to return
a signed letter or form for students to participate. Howev er, parents ma y
choose to opt their child out of the surv ey. Any child whose parent has opted
them out ma y be allowed to work on something else during the surv ey
administr ation time.
During surv ey administr ation students will be reminded that the surv ey is
voluntary and an yone who chooses not to complete it ma y do so . The
introductory language on the surv ey itself emphasiz es the v oluntary nature
of this surv ey opportunit y. Students who click ""Continue"" are assenting to
participate. The language also explains that there are procedures will to
ensure the securit y of participant's data and that no names, Student IDs,
date of births, addresses, or an y other identifiable information will be
collected. If students choose to skip an y question they ma y do so . See
""R2A_Phase2_Student Surv ey_v1_21Mar22"" for specific language.
Please provide an overview of the proposed modifications to your
survey/instruments
The surv ey includes the following items corresponding to the following areas
of inquiry: 1) Basic demogr aphic information including gender identit y,
race/ethnicit y, age, and gr ade; 2) F amiliarit y/knowledge of the current
reporting procedures; 3) P erceiv ed barriers to reporting; and 4) Suggestions
for impro vements to the reporting system. This surv ey includes fix ed option
questions including Lik ert-type and multiple choice questions. The surv ey has
been dev eloped based on existing liter ature, our project ’s qualitativ e
findings, and insights from the OSP staff members working on the project.
The surv ey is progr ammed in Qualtrics and is intended to tak e no more than
10 minutes to complete. The surv ey instrument will be made a vailable in
English and Spanish. Students ma y select their preferred language. Thesurvey file is titled, “R2A_Phase2_Student Surv ey_v1_21Mar22. ”
The surv ey does NO T ask about experiences of sexual misconduct or
experiences reporting sexual misconduct. The surv ey is intended to measure
student perceptions of the reporting procedures and reporting beha viors, not
frequency or the nature of experiences of abuse or har assment. Therefore,
we believ e participation constitutes only minimal risk. Student participation in
the surv ey is v oluntary . Parental notification of all CPS students in vited to
participate will be required and schools will need to distribute these
notifications prior to surv ey administr ation. All schools who participate in in
the surv ey will be required to distribute the parent notification letter , “Parent
Notification letter_v1_21Mar22. ” (Please note that the Spanish v ersion of the
survey, as well as the P arent Notification letter are currently being tr anslated
and will be finaliz ed and submitted to the RRB once the English v ersions ha ve
been appro ved).
Please provide an overview of the proposed modifications to the type
of data collected
Again, with this modification we are adding a student surv ey component as a
second phase of this project. Principals will be contacted about offering their
students the opportunit y to participate in the student surv ey. They will be
asked to designate a school lev el surv ey coordinator (e.g. AP , PE/Health
Teacher W ellness Champions, etc.) and will be pro vided the option to select a
time to schedule surv ey administr ation that is con venient for their school and
will not conflict with student instructional time. The surv ey is electronic and
should not tak e more than 10 minutes for students to complete. Schools will
be encour aged to allow students time to complete the surv ey during
advisory , homeroom, or another time when students can dev ote a few
minutes. Students will be able to enter the URL or scan a QR code into their
Chromebooks or other electronic device.

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Chicago Public Schools’ Office of Student Protections and Title IX (OSP) data
reveals disproportionate reporting of sexual misconduct across r acial/ethnic
groups of students. Howev er, Youth Risk Beha vior Surv eillance data for the
CPS student population rev eals no differences in bullying or sexual violence
among these groups. OSP is collabor ating with the study team at the
University of Illinois at Chicago to explore these reporting disparities and to
expand their capacit y to conduct this work.  In Phase 1 of the project, we
collected qualitativ e data from students, parents, and staff through focus
groups and k ey informant interviews. Ov erall objectiv es of Phase 1 of this
project were to determine students’ , CPS staff , and parents/caregiv ers’
current knowledge and understanding of CPS’ s Title IX R eporting tool and
reporting processes and perceptions of the factors influencing reporting, as
well as understand the str ategies being used to communicate to students
about the existence of the reporting tool and reporting processes. Phase 1
findings ha ve been used to inform the dev elopment of a surv ey that will be
administered to appro ximately 1200-1500 CPS high school students in Phase
2 of this project. Findings from the surv ey will be used to compare
perceptions and reported barriers and facilitators b y key CPS student
demogr aphic groups and most importantly to identif y recommendations to
ease reporting, e.g. policy changes, increased education, impro ved
messaging, etc. CPS OSP aims to use the study results to impro ve
communication about the policy and procedures to increase a wareness and
reduce barriers to student reporting.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
This ev aluation will explore the following aims: 1) What are the perceptions
of the reporting system and facilitators and barriers to reporting, among CPS
students?; 2) How do perceptions and reported barriers and facilitators v ary
by key CPS student demogr aphic groups?; and 3) What are
recommendations to ease reporting, e.g. policy changes, increased
education, impro ved messaging, etc.? It is h ypothesiz ed that the following
outcomes will be achiev ed during this project: 1) The identification of
common factors that influence reporting and 2) the dev elopment of a set of
actionable recommendations to impro ve communication about the policy and
procedures to increase a wareness and reduce barriers to student reporting.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
In the United States, sexual har assment and related occurrences among
middle and high school students are a relativ ely common occurrence.
Howev er, specific r ates of sexual har assment for this population v ary widely
across studies due to differences in definitions and study populations
(Mitchell, Ybarr a, & K orchmaros, 2014). R eports r ange from 10% - 80% of
adolescents experiencing sexual har assment, with differences b y gender ,
gender identit y, race, and sexual orientation (Fink elhor et al. , 2013; Lipson,
2001; Mitchell, Ybarr a, & K orchmaros, 2014; P etersen & Hy de, 2009).
Instances of sexual har assment can occur in-person or online and ma y be
perpetr ated b y peers or adults (i.e. , teachers or school staff ). These
incidents can ha ve negativ e beha vioral, emotional, educational, and health
consequences, the negativ e effects of which appear strongest for y oung
female students (Chiodo , et al. , 2009; Gruber & Finer an, 2007; Hand &
Sanchez, 2000). According to 2019 Y outh Risk Beha vior Surv eillance (YRBS)
data, in Chicago , appro ximately 1 in 10 students has reported being bullied
on school propert y and being electronically bullied (CDC, 2019). T welve
percent of y outh did not go to school due to feeling unsafe, and 13% ha ve
experienced sexual violence b y anyone in the past 12 months (CDC, 2019).
                CPS's Office of Student Protections and Title IX w as formally
launched in 2018 -created following a formal external review of all pr actices,
policies, and procedures for addressing sexual misconduct across the
district. The Office's mission is to ensure all students and staff are safe from
sex/gender discrimination, sexual har assment, and sexual violence and
misconduct at CPS . OSP has three units aligned with specific functions,
including In vestigations, Compliance and T raining, and a Coordination Unit.
The Coordination Unit is responsible for coordinating the district's response
to all reports of sexual misconduct affecting students. Students can mak e
reports through a newly -established comprehensiv e system that allows for
complaints to be reported online, via email, phone, or in-person—ensuring
that ev ery incident reported is fully addressed, resolv ed, and documented.
In addition to tr acking and following up incidents, OSP works collabor atively
across the district to tr ain staff , students, and families and creates,
develops, and implements prev ention progr amming for all students.
                OSP collects and reports incident data quarterly . Data currently
reveals disproportionate reporting across k ey racial/ethnic groups of
students.  R elativ e to the o verall CPS demogr aphics, Hispanic/Latinx and
White students are underrepresented while Black/African- American (AA)
students constitute the majorit y of complainants. YRBS data indicate no
significant differences in experiences of bullying or sexual violence among
Hispanic/Latinx, Black/AA, and White students (CDC, 2019). In addition to
asking about sexual violence more gener ally, YRBS asks students if they
have been forced to ha ve sexual intercourse in the past 12 months.
Black/AA and Hispanic/Latinx students both report ha ving had this
experience at significantly higher r ates than White students, y et not
significantly different from one another (CDC, 2019). Black/AA students andHispanic/Latinx students appear to experience similar har assment and
sexual misconduct r ates of all kinds. Y et, Hispanic/Latinx students, who
constitute 47% of the student population, are not making reports as
frequently as Black/AA students.
                While data on reporting beha viors of K -12 student populations is
limited, data from the college lev el indicates that a lack of knowledge of
anti-har assment policies, a lack of knowledge of how to mak e reports, and a
belief that reports will receiv e no response are common reporting barriers
(O'Connor et al. , 2017; W ozencroft et al. , 2015). There ma y be w ays in
which the messaging pro vided currently is not appropriately tailored to
specific groups. There are also lik ely structur al and systemic issues resulting
from centuries of r acism and discrimination that ma y influence the reporting
inequities. This project seeks to answer the following relev ant questions: 1)
Why are there different r ates in reporting beha viors of sexual har assment
and misconduct across CPS schools in the district, 2) how do , and to what
extent, do these barriers in reporting pla y a role in the disparities in
reporting beha viors of sexual har assment and misconduct across CPS
schools in the district, and 3) what opportunities are there to change policy ,
messaging, and current procedures to address these underlying inequities in
reporting among CPS schools in the district? A phased, mix ed-methods
approach will be emplo yed to address these questions and is currently
funded b y the Doris Duk e Foundation's R esearch 2 Action gr ant.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
Collection of Primary Key Informant Interview Data
(Approved October 21, 2021)
Purpose
School staff that work in high schools will be interviewed to understand how
staff members communicate to students about the existence of the reporting
tool and reporting processes and current perceptions of the factors
influencing reporting. 
Eligibility
School staff will NO T be eligible if they 1) are not currently a CPS emplo yee
assigned to work at a selected high school 2) and are not a teacher ,
counselors, social work ers, GS A sponsors, or in a role that does not in volve
direct contact with CPS students regularly . 
Sampling & Recruitment
In consultation with our CPS partners, a list of up to 12 k ey informants will
be purposiv ely selected to participate in semi-structured interviews (P atton,
2012). These stak eholders will include teachers, school social work ers,
Genders and Sexualities Alliances (GS A) sponsors, and other k ey
stakeholders selected based on their known pro ximity to students, including
students. A Project Advisory Committee (P AC) has been con vened, which
includes k ey stak eholders that meet quarterly . The P AC will include, but not
be limited to , the Chief of OSP , as well as representativ es from other CPS
departments including the Office of Social Emotional Learning, the Office of
Student Health and W ellness (OSHW), and the F amily and Communit y
Engagement in Education unit. The P AC will pro vide advice and insight on
the project's design, data collection, and interpretation of preliminary
findings. Using input from the P AC, 12 k ey informants will be purposiv ely
selected to participate in semi-structured interviews (P atton, 2012).  
The UIC ev aluation team also has an existing relationship with OSHW (who
is part of the P AC), and currently works as their ev aluators. Due to this, the
UIC ev aluation team has already established a relationship with GS A
sponsors and GS A's in CPS schools and teachers, counselors, and social
workers. UIC ev aluators will lev erage these existing relationships to recruit
GSA sponsors, teachers, counselors, and social work ers. Individuals
identified as potential participants will receiv e a recruitment email (see
""R2A_Phase1_Staff Interview R ecruitment Script_v1_092121"" for specific
email text) from a member of the UIC ev aluation team informing them of
their selection for the study and requesting their participation. A research
team member will mak e a follow -up email or phone call to answer an yquestions about the study and request an appointment to conduct the
interview .  Those who do not respond after three attempts will be replaced
with another selected school contact.
Collection of Stakeholder Focus Group Data 
(Approved October 21, 2021)
Purpose
Group discussions with high school students will be conducted to understand
how the existence of the reporting tool and reporting processes are being
communicated to them and to understand the current perceptions of the
factors influencing students’ reporting of sexual misconduct. Similar
discussions will be held with parents of high school students to understand
how the reporting tool and reporting processes are being communicated to
families, and what they perceiv e are the factors influencing students’
likelihood of reporting.
Eligibility
Parents will NO T be eligible if they 1) are not currently a parent or guardian
of a student attending a CPS High School 2) Not a part of the selected
Parent Advisory Council/P arent Leadership Network. Students are NO T
eligible to participate in focus groups if they are 1) not currently attending a
CPS high school 2) and do not participate or belong to a Student V oice
Committee or Gender Sexualit y Alliance. All student participants will be
required to pro vide assent/consent for participation in these activities, and
students under age 18 will be required to ha ve written parent permission.  
Sampling & Recruitment
Purposiv e sampling will be used to select Networks and schools from which
parent/caregiv ers and students will be recruited. UIC ev aluators will use our
existing relationships with CPS’ s Office of Student Health and W ellness and
member organizations within P AC to assist in selecting schools and networks
from which to recruit parents & students for focus groups. F ocus groups will
be conducted with parents/caregiv ers of the F amily Adv ocacy Communit y
Engagement (F ACE) 's P arent Advisory Council/P arent Leadership Network
(PAC/PLN). R oughly 2-4 focus groups will be held with parents. A t least one
focus group will be held with parents from a CPS Network consisting mainly
of Hispanic/Latinx families, and another focus groups with parents from a
Network made up of predominantly Black/AA families. High school students
will be recruited from Student V oice Committees and Gender Sexualit y
Alliances.  Currently , the UIC ev aluation team serv es as ev aluators for the
OSHW initiativ e that focuses on building the capacit y of schools to dev elop
and build Gender Sexualit y Alliances in schools. The team will be using our
pre-existing relationship with OSHW and GS A club sponsors to recruit
students for focus groups. The UIC ev aluation team will also use P AC
members' pre-existing relationships with schools and school administr ation
to connect us to their Student V oice Committees.   Student focus groups will
be selected in a similar fashion to parent focus groups.  T wo focus groups
with student v oice committees will be held with students from a schoolmainly consisting of Hispanic/Latinx families and another school consisting of
mainly Black/AA families. Finally , a third focus group will be held with
students participating in GS A. A total of 5-7 focus groups will be conducted
for this ev aluation, with roughly 20 parents/caregiv ers and 30 students
participating in focus groups. 
UIC in vestigators will work with our P AC partners to recruit students and
parents for focus group discussions.  T o recruit P AC/PLN members, we will
work with F ACE Network Managers to identif y members of the P AC/PLN
group who are eligible for this ev aluation and to share copies of the
evaluation's recruitment materials.  The F ACE Manager will share the
recruitment information (""R2A_Phase1_P arent-FACE F ocus Group
Recruitment Script_v1_092121"") with the P AC/PLN members so they can
understand the purpose of the discussion group .  UIC in vestigators will work
with Network Managers to identif y a date and time to speak with P AC/PLN
members to pro vide an o verview of the ev aluation and answer an y questions
they ma y have. During this time, parents who are interested and eligible will
be pro vided the opportunit y to sign up for participation in the ev aluation. F or
student recruitment, staff members that serv e as the school club sponsors
for high school GS As and student v oice committees will be contacted b y a
member of the UIC ev aluation team. An introductory email will be sent to
school sponsors, pro viding an o verview of the ev aluation and asking if they
would lik e to learn more about the ev aluation. After the club sponsor has
expressed willingness to learn about the ev aluation, the UIC in vestigator will
meet with the sponsor and pro vide an o verview of the ev aluation. UIC
investigators will work together with school club sponsors to identif y a date
and time to speak with students to pro vide an o verview of the ev aluation
and answer an y questions. Copies of the ev aluation's recruitment materials,
as shown in ""R2A_Phase1_Student F ocus Group  R ecruitment
Script_v1_092121"" & ""R2A_Phase1_Student F ocus Group  R ecruitment
Script PPT_v1_092121"",  will be shared with students during this meeting.
The UIC ev aluation team and GS A & Student V oice Committee club sponsors
will also work together to identif y eligible students for this ev aluation.
Collection of Student Survey Data
(Submitted as new component on March 21, 2022)
Purpose
The surv ey aims to assess perceptions of the reporting system and
facilitators and barriers to reporting, among CPS students. W e will also be
collecting demogr aphic information so as to facilitate a comparison of
perceptions and reported barriers and facilitators b y key CPS student
demogr aphic groups.
Instrument
The surv ey includes the following items corresponding to the following areas
of inquiry: 1) Basic demogr aphic information including gender identit y,
race/ethnicit y, age, and gr ade; 2) F amiliarit y/knowledge of the current
reporting procedures; 3) P erceiv ed barriers to reporting; and 4) Suggestions
for impro vements to the reporting system. This surv ey includes fix ed optionquestions including Lik ert-type and multiple choice questions. The surv ey
has been dev eloped based on existing liter ature, our project ’s Phase 1
qualitativ e findings, and insights from the OSP staff members working on
the project. The surv ey is progr amed in Qualtrics and is intended to tak e no
more than 10 minutes to complete. The surv ey instrument is a vailable in
English and Spanish. Students ma y select their preferred language. The
survey file is titled, “R2A_Phase2_Student Surv ey_v1_21Mar22. ” 
Finally , the surv ey does NO T ask about experiences of sexual misconduct or
experiences reporting sexual misconduct. The surv ey is intended to measure
student perceptions of the reporting procedures and reporting beha viors, not
frequency or the nature of experiences of abuse or har assment. Therefore,
we believ e participation constitutes only minimal risk. Student participation
in the surv ey is v oluntary .
Parental notification of all CPS students in vited to participate will be required
and schools will need to distribute these notifications prior to surv ey
administr ation. All schools who participate in in the surv ey will be required
to distribute the parent notification letter , “Parent Notification
letter_23F eb22. ”
Eligibility
A purposiv e sample of high Schools in Networks 14, 15, 16, and 17 will be
invited to participate.  All students who are enrolled CPS high school (gr ades
9-12) students will be eligible to participate. 
Sampling & Recruitment
Purposiv e sampling will be used to recruit schools from which students will
be offered the opportunit y to tak e the surv ey. UIC ev aluators will use our
existing relationships with CPS’ s Office of Student Protections and member
organizations within the Project Advisory Committee to assist in selecting
schools for recruitment with an aim to ensure a mix of schools based on
geogr aphy, demogr aphics, school t ype, etc. OSP study team members will
reach out to administr ators (i.e. , principals) of target schools and explain the
survey purpose and opportunit y. Prior experience indicates that principal
buy-in and their communication to teaching staff are k ey factors in achieving
a strong response r ate. In acknowledgement of the additional time required
to engage in the surv ey, the first 10 schools who agree to participate will
receiv e a stipend of $250 that can be used to support student activities. W e
anticipate 8-10 schools will participate in the surv ey with student
populations of between 100 and 500, with an a verage population of 300
students. Assuming a 50% response r ate to the surv ey, we anticipate a
sample of 1,200 - 1,500 student respondents. 
Principals of high schools in Networks 14, 15, 16, and 17  will receiv e emails
(see ""R2A_Phase2_School Surv ey Recruitment Script_v1_XXMar22"" for
specific email text) from an OSP Staff Member informing them of their
selection for the study and requesting their participation. An ev aluation team
member will mak e a follow -up email or phone call to answer an y questions
about the project. If the principal agrees they will be ask ed to assign a
coordinator for the project (e.g. AP , PE/Health T eacher W ellness Champions,etc.) and request time to for a 10-15 minute call to discuss logistics for
survey administr ation.  Those who do not respond after three attempts will
be replaced with another selected school principal.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
Analysis of Primary Key Informant Interview Data
(Approved October 21, 2021)
Data Collection and Analysis       
Participants will be pro vided the option to select a time to participate in
interviews to select a time that is con venient for them and will not conflict
with that individual's work responsibilities. Interviews will be appro ximately
30-45-minutes long and will tak e place virtually o ver Zoom or Google Meet.
Before the interview , individuals who choose to participate will be
encour aged to review and sign an informed consent document,
“R2A_Phase1_Staff Interview Consent F orm_v1_092121” . Participants will
be ask ed to consent to participate and be recorded separ ately. Prior to the
interview , the document will be reviewed aloud b y an ev aluation team.
Participants will be allowed to ask an y questions and review and sign the
document before the interview . Our protocol emphasiz es the v oluntary
nature of these interviews. It allows respondents to decline participation
altogether , refuse to answer an y given question they feel uncomfortable
answering, or withdr aw from the interview at an y time. Questions that will
be ask ed during the interview are described in “R2A_Phase1_Staff Interview
guide_v1_092121” . The questions for the interviews are not expected to
solicit an y sensitiv e information or result in an y physical or non-ph ysical
risks. School staff participants will be offered a $50 gift card as an incentiv e
for interview participation and as compensation for their participation. Notes
will be tak en during the interview and reviewed for preliminary themes.
Procedures will ensure confidentialit y and securit y of participant's data and
are described in detail later in the protocol.
Since the goal of Phase 1 activities is to inform surv ey dev elopment, a r apid
qualitativ e data analysis approach will be used. The Fr amework Method
(Gale et al. , 2013) will be used during analysis, in which textual data is
abstracted for k ey themes and entered into a matrix aligned with k ey
analysis questions. This method w as chosen because it is compar able to
other more in-depth qualitativ e approaches when aiming to adhere to
practice-based timelines (Gale et al. , 2019). T ranscripts will be coded b y UIC
researchers- Elizabeth Jarpe-R atner, Kristen Belcher , and Abi Bloedel. Data
from k ey informant interviews will be used to inform the v ocabulary used
within the surv ey and dev elop response options for items in the surv ey.
Analysis of Stakeholder Focus Group Data 
(Approved October 21, 2021)
Data Collection and Analysis       
The ev aluation team will ensure that group discussions will be held at a time
that will not conflict with students' classroom time and parents' workresponsibilities b y working with Network Managers and school club sponsors
to identif y the best time and date to hold focus group discussions-i.e. during
their regularly scheduled meetings or a separ ate da y and time. F ocus Group
discussions with parents and students will be appro ximately 45-60 minutes
long and held virtually o ver Zoom or Google Meet. Individuals who choose to
participate will be encour aged to review and sign an informed consent
document (R2A_Phase1_P arent-FACE F ocus Group Consent
Form_Eng_v1_092121 and R2A_Phase1_P arent-FACE F ocus Group Consent
Form_Span_v1_092121).  Students that are under the age of 18 will be
required to pro vide written assent (R2A_Phase1_Student F ocus Group
Assent F orm_v2_102121), as well as parental consent
(R2A_Phase1_Student F ocus Group P arental P ermission F orm_v2_102121)
to participate in focus group discussions.  P articipants will be ask ed to
provide consent to participate in focus group discussions and to be recorded
separ ately. Focus groups will not be recorded if one or more focus group
participants decline to be recorded during the discussion. F or student focus
groups, parental and student consent must be acquired for all participants.
Extensiv e note-taking, in lieu of recording, will be done b y one of the focus
group moder ators to capture the experiences and perceptions of
participants. Also , UIC ev aluation team members will ensure that a CPS
school staff member will  be onsite and present during student focus group
discussions. The school staff member (school club sponsor) that supervises
and hosts the club’ s activities will be selected to ensure that a CPS school
staff member will be onsite and present during data collection. 
 Informed consent/assent documents will be reviewed with participants
allowing participants the chance to ask questions. The questions included in
these discussion groups are not expected to solicit an y sensitiv e information
or result in an y physical or non-ph ysical risks. R espondents can decline
participation altogether , refuse to answer an y given question they feel
uncomfortable answering, or withdr aw from the interview at an y time.
Before the scheduled discussion group session, eligibilit y criteria of
attendees will be reviewed to ensure that all who participate are eligible.
Evaluators will ensure that all individual consent/assent are collected from
participants.
The k ey questions guiding  focus groups with students and parents include
the following: 1) understanding of k ey vocabulary terms used in the current
reporting process; 2) knowledge of the reporting systems and modes of
reporting; 3) communication str ategies to students around the existence of
the reporting tool and reporting processes; and 4) perceptions of factors
influencing reporting (e.g. ease of use of the tools, understanding of what
will happen following reporting, understanding of confidentialit y, etc.).
Questions ask ed during focus group discussions are described in
""R2A_Phase1_P arent-FACE F ocus Group guide_v1_092121"" for parents and
in  ""R2A_Phase1_Student F ocus Group guide_v1_092121"" for students. .  
Procedures to ensure confidentialit y and securit y of participant's data are
described below . Adult participants will be offered a $50 gift card, and
students will receiv e a $25 gift card as an incentiv e for participation and
compensation for their participation. 
A student ’s personal experiences or their peer ’s personal experiences ofsexual misconduct is not the focus of this project. Thus, these questions will
not be ask ed of students participating in focus group discussions. Howev er,
there is a chance that these discussions ma y cause some students to
become emotional. Students will be reminded prior to the focus group that
they can skip questions they do not w ant to answer and stop participating in
the discussion altogether . A member of the ev aluation team, alongside the
school club sponsor that is onsite,  will work together to contact a support
staff member at the school if the student requests it. This information is also
described in the R2A_Phase1_Student F ocus Group Assent F orm_v2_102121
and R2A_Phase1_Student F ocus Group guide_v2_102121. In the case that a
student discloses their experience or a peer ’s experience during the focus
groups, the Office of Student and Title IX has procedures in place to assist
staff in addressing incidents of sexual misconduct. CPS Staff are tr ained and
required to tak e specializ ed training in responding to disclosure of incidents
of sexual misconduct. The ev aluation team and the Office of Student
Protections and Title IX will ha ve materials and resources on hand (see
“TITLE IX AND SEXU AL MISCONDUCT MANDA TORY REPOR TING
PROCEDURE” and “Office of Student Protections & Title IX (OSP) Procedure
Manual”) to pro vide to the CPS school club sponsor that is on site to assist in
this process. The ev aluator , alongside the CPS school staff member ,  will
work together to contact a support staff member at the student ’s school. If
the student needs access to communit y-based resources, the OSP pro vides a
list of communit y based organizations that pro vides resources for students
that are victims of sexual misconduct (See Appendix D: R esource Guide of
“Office of Student Protections & Title IX (OSP) Procedure Manual”).  An y
information related to this disclosure will be redacted from the recording,
transcript, and an y notes tak en during the discussion.
Identical to the analysis approach used for k ey informant interviews, a r apid
qualitativ e data analysis approach will be used alongside The Fr amework
Method (Gale et al. , 2013). As described abo ve, the abstr action of k ey
themes from the data will be entered into a matrix aligned with the main
analysis questions. This method is compar able to other in-depth qualitativ e
approaches when adhering to pr actice-based timelines (Gale et al. , 2019).
Notes tak en during these focus groups will be reviewed for preliminary
themes. UIC researchers will then code tr anscripts from focus groups. Data
from focus groups with students and parents/caregiv ers, alongside k ey
informant interviews, will be used to inform the surv ey's v ocabulary and
develop response options for items in the surv ey.
Analysis of Student Survey Data
(Submitted as new component on March 21, 2022)
Data Collection and Analysis
Again, with this modification we are adding a student surv ey component as
a second phase of this project. Principals will be contacted about offering
their students the opportunit y to participate in the student surv ey. They will
be ask ed to designate a school lev el surv ey coordinator (e.g. AP , PE/Health
Teacher W ellness Champions, etc.) and will be pro vided the option to select
a time to schedule surv ey administr ation that is con venient for their schooland will not conflict with student instructional time. The surv ey is electronic
and should not tak e more than 10 minutes for students to complete. Schools
will be encour aged to allow students time to complete the surv ey during
advisory , homeroom, or another time when students can dev ote a few
minutes. Students will be able to enter the URL or scan a QR code into their
Chromebooks or other electronic device. 
Schools will be ask ed to send home the parents notification letter one week
prior to the planned surv ey administr ation, “R2A_Phase2_P arent
Notification_v1_21Mar22” . Schools will be reminded during the 10-15
minutes call with the coordinator that it is not necessary for parents to
return a signed letter or form for students to participate. Howev er, parents
may choose to opt their child out of the surv ey. Any child whose parent has
opted them out ma y be allowed to work on something else during the surv ey
administr ation time. 
During surv ey administr ation students will be reminded that the surv ey is
voluntary and an yone who chooses not to complete it ma y do so .  The
introductory language on the surv ey itself emphasiz es the v oluntary nature
of this surv ey opportunit y. Students who click continue are assenting to
participate. The language also explains that there are procedures will to
ensure the securit y of participant's data and that no names, Student IDs,
date of births, addresses, or an y other identifiable information will be
collected. If students choose to skip an y question they ma y do so . See
""R2A_Phase2_Student Surv ey_v1_21Mar22"" for specific language.  
The surv ey analysis, including univ ariate and biv ariate descriptiv e
frequencies and measures of centr al tendency , will be conducted b y the UIC
evaluation team. Findings ma y be reported b y demogr aphic group . Howev er,
the case of small cell siz es for certain gr ade lev el and r acial/demogr aphic
groups, these data will not be reported."

Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
To recruit teacher leaders and district leaders for the study , we will attend an
online teacher leader meeting (which occur monthly via Google Meet in the
district). W e will share a recruitment slide that we will v erbally describe and
invite teacher leaders and district leaders who are potentially interested to
email the PI to discuss next steps.
To recruit teachers participating in PL Cs, we will share a recruitment flier
that teacher leaders will distribute at one of their PL C meetings, in viting
teachers who are potentially interested to email the PI to discuss next steps.
We will follow up with interested participants individually b y emailing them
the consent form using North western Qualtrics. W e will in vite potential
participants to review the consent form and email or call the PI with an y
questions they ha ve before deciding whether to participate. If they wish to
participate, they will complete the consent form via North western Qualtrics
and click “I Agree” to pro vide a digital record, and we will follow up with
them b y email to schedule their interview . If they do not wish to participate,
they can click “I Disagree” or select X in the corner of their browser to close
the window .
For teacher leaders, teachers participating in PL Cs, and district leaders who
consent to participate, we will conduct one-on-one interviews via Google
Meet at a time of mutual con venience during the months of Ma y-July (as
PLCs culminate for the school y ear). Each participant will engage in one 30-
45-minute interview , which is also the estimated total time for completion of
all study activities. Interviews with teacher leaders will focus on their
motiv ations for becoming teacher leaders, gener al reflections on their
experiences and facilitation in PL Cs, experiences/challenges being
responsiv e to teachers and supporting equitable participation, and
applications and next steps they see for themselv es. Interviews with
teachers participating in PL Cs will focus on their motiv ations for joining PL Cs,
gener al reflections on their experiences in the PL Cs, and applications and
next steps they see for themselv es. Interviews with district leaders will focus

Appro ximately 15–20 African American women leaders in CPS , including
principals, assistant principals, and district administr ators.
Selection will follow purposiv e sampling to ensure participants ha ve direct
experience with the phenomenon of interest (code-switching in leadership
roles).
Researcher: The researcher will serv e as the interviewer , facilitating
discussions, managing confidentialit y, and ensuring ethical consider ations
are upheld. While I work as the Student Mobilit y Manager at CPS Centr al
Office, this research is conducted solely as part of m y doctor al studies.
Participation in this study will not impact participants’ roles at CPS , including
compensation, emplo yment decisions, resource allocation, or an y other
aspect of emplo yment.","Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
This qualitativ e phenomenological study explores the liv ed experiences of
African American women leaders within the Chicago Public Schools (CPS)
district, focusing on their perceptions and experiences with code-switching in
professional settings. Code-switching, the pr actice of adapting language,
behavior, or appear ance to align with cultur al or professional norms, has
profound implications for identit y, mental well-being, and leadership efficacy .
Guided b y Social Cognitiv e Theory and Critical R ace Theory , the study seeks
to unco ver how these leaders na vigate the challenges of code-switching, the
psychological impacts of this beha vior, and its influence on their job
satisfaction and professional inter actions.
Code switching impacts African- American women b y requiring them to alter
their speech, beha vior, or appear ance to na vigate predominantly White or
non-Black professional en vironments, which often leads to emotional
fatigue, diminished authenticit y, and barriers to career progression. Within
CPS, this dynamic ma y further perpetuate inequities, as African- American
women na vigate professional expectations in an educational context rooted
in systemic disparities. A positionalit y statement will outline m y identit y,
professional background at CPS , and commitment to amplif ying the v oices of
African- American women through this research.
Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews with 15-20 CPS
leaders, including principals, assistant principals, and district administr ators.
Using NViv o softw are, a thematic analysis will identif y patterns and themes
related to the participants' experiences, offering nuanced insights into the
factors shaping their leadership roles. Official CPS communication channels
(e.g., internal emails, staff memos) will not be used for recruitment or
distribution of study materials. Instead, recruitment will occur via external
means, such as personal outreach or non-CPS- affiliated platforms, to ensure
the study is distinct from CPS initiativ es. The findings aim to highlight the
toll of code-switching on mental health and professional identit y while
informing organizational str ategies to foster equit y and inclusivit y within
educational settings. 
This study has the potential to amplif y the v oices of African American
women leaders, pro viding critical insights into systemic barriers and
actionable recommendations for creating supportiv e professional
environments. The findings could be shared with CPS T alent to inform
recruitment and retention str ategies, integr ated into SafeSchools tr aining to
enhance cultur al competency and address discrimination, and used to
develop workshops or discussions to support African- American emplo yees in
the workplace. The results will contribute to the broader discourse on
diversity and inclusion in leadership , advancing efforts to promote equitable
practices in education and bey ond","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.

RQ5
How does code-switching beha vior affect job satisfaction among African
American women leaders in educational leadership roles?","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The concept of code-switching has its roots in sociolinguistics, where it w as
initially studied as a linguistic phenomenon used b y bilingual or multilingual
speak ers to alternate between languages within a single con versation or
context. Ov er time, research expanded to include cultur al and beha vioral
dimensions, particularly in contexts where individuals from marginaliz ed
communities adapt their language, beha vior, or appear ance to align with
dominant cultur al or professional norms.
For African Americans, code-switching has been extensiv ely explored in
relation to African American V ernacular English (AA VE) and its juxtaposition
with Standard American English (S AE). Scholars lik e Genev a Smitherman
and Alim & R eyes ha ve documented how language use serv es as both a tool
for cultur al identit y and a means of na vigating systemic barriers in
professional and social contexts. The broader sociological implications of
code-switching ha ve been addressed through fr ameworks lik e Critical R ace
Theory (CR T), which highlights the systemic pressures driving individuals
from marginaliz ed groups to code-switch as a surviv al strategy in spaces
governed b y white cultur al norms.
Current Research Trends
Recent studies ha ve shifted to examine the psy chological, emotional, and
professional dimensions of code-switching. K ey areas of focus include:
Psychological Impact : Research has demonstr ated that code-
switching can lead to cognitiv e and emotional str ain, as individuals
navigate the dual pressures of authenticit y and assimilation. Studies
highlight its association with stress, anxiet y, and feelings of
inauthenticit y.
Leadership and Professional Contexts : Liter ature specific to
African American women in leadership positions, such as works b y Bell
(1980) and Ev ans-Winters (2021), addresses how code-switching
intersects with gendered and r acializ ed expectations. African American
women leaders often face unique challenges in predominantly white
professional en vironments, where their leadership st yles and cultur al
expressions ma y be scrutiniz ed or underv alued.
Self-Efficacy and Identity : Code-switching has been link ed to self -
efficacy beliefs and professional identit y. Research b y Bandur a (1986)
on Social Cognitiv e Theory underscores how personal beliefs and
environmental factors influence beha viors lik e code-switching, while
CRT situates these beha viors within broader systemic inequalities.
Gaps in the Literature
Although the psy chological and professional impacts of code-switching ha ve
been explored, there is limited research specifically focused on AfricanAmerican women leaders in educational settings, particularly within urban
school districts lik e CPS . Additionally , few studies comprehensiv ely examine
the intersectionalit y of r ace, gender , and leadership in relation to code-
switching, lea ving critical gaps in understanding its full implications.","and Student/Staff Involvement

Elementary Computer Science Education
While tr aditionally a subject for high school and bey ond, there is growing demand for
bringing CS into K -8 classrooms. Early work on progr amming as a means for learning
conducted b y Papert and colleagues with the Logo language found that progr amming w as
accessible to y ounger learners and could serv e as a powerful pedagogical str ategy (Harel
& Papert, 1990; P apert, 1980; P apert, W att, diSessa, & W eir, 1979). In this early work,
progr amming w as framed as a w ay to dev elop mathematical thinking as opposed to
formal computer science (P apert, 1972), but the underlying ideas where shared. In the
last decade, bringing CS to K -8 has grown in popularit y and has been facilitated b y
progr amming tools designed for y oung learners (Duncan, Bell, & T animoto , 2014;
Kelleher & P ausch, 2005). An increasingly popular approach for creating engaging and
accessible progr amming en vironments is the gr aphical, blocks-based progr amming
interface. Led b y the popularit y of the Scr atch en vironment, blocks-based progr amming
tools allow users to use a dr ag-and-drop approach to constructing progr ams. Blocks-
based progr amming tools include scaffolds that mak e progr amming easier , including
limiting syntax errors, pro viding visual cues on how commands can be used, and
providing an easy w ay to browse a vailable commands (W eintrop & Wilensky , 2015).
Blocks-based progr amming interfaces has been used to creating a div erse arr ay of
progr amming en vironments and tools, including museum exhibits (Horn, Br ady, Hjorth,
Wagh, & Wilensky , 2014), libr aries for controlling robots (Millner & Baafi, 2011), and tools
for creating mobile applications (W olber, Abelson, Spertus, & Looney , 2011).
While the groundswell of support for CS education has helped spur the creation of a
growing number of progr amming en vironments for y ounger learners, that ex citement has
resulted in a relativ ely small number of CS curricula designed for elementary classrooms.
This is in part due to the fact that en vironments lik e Scratch were not initially designed
for classrooms, instead focusing on informal spaces lik e afterschool progr ams (Maloney ,
Peppler , Kafai, R esnick, & R usk, 2008) and placed an emphasis on self -directed learning
and online collabor ation (Maloney , Resnick, R usk, Silv erman, & Eastmond, 2010; R oque,
Kafai, & Fields, 2012). Current elementary CS curricula include the F oundations for
Advancing Computational Thinking (F ACT) curriculum (Gro ver, Pea, & Cooper , 2015) and
the Creativ e Computing curriculum dev eloped b y Brennan and the Scr atchEd team. There
is also a growing libr ary of curricula designed for early elementary learning created using
specially designed progr amming en vironments, lik e the KELP-CS curriculum and LaPla ya
progr amming en vironment (Hill, Dwy er, Martinez, Harlow , & Fr anklin, 2015). Currently
these curricula are all intended to serv e as a students’ first introductory to CS in a formal
context. There is no widely used curriculum designed to serv e as an adv anced CS course
for elementary learners, a gap this proposal intends to address. Instead, teachers search
online for resources from v enues lik e ScratchEd and then adapt them to their needs,
schools purchase closed packages, or teachers create their own. All three options are ill-
suited to teachers with little experience in computing.
Culturally Relevant Computer Science Curricula
A major contribution of the field of Learning Science is the recognition that aligning
content with the culture, prior experience, and social v alues and norms of the learner can
yield powerful learning outcomes (C. D . Lee, 2007; Moll, Amanti, Neff , & Gonzalez, 1992;
Nasir, Rosebery , Warren, & Lee, 2006; R ogoff, 2003). Examples of cultur ally responsiv e
curricula can be found across math (Nasir , Hand, & T aylor, 2008), science (Erickson &
Gutierrez, 2002), and English language arts (C. D . Lee, 2001). R esponding to this
literature, in recent y ears, the same has become true for computer science. A notable
example of this is the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum, which w as designedto engage div erse high school students with CS topics through hands-on, cultur ally
relevant instruction (R yoo, Margolis, Lee, Sando val, & Goode, 2013). It accomplishes this
goal b y framing “CS learning around [students’] own questions and interests, cultur ally
relevant pedagogy dr awing on students’ funds of knowledge, and core CS concepts
relating to our ev eryday uses of new technology and participatory media” (R yoo et al. ,
2013, pp . 4–5).
Computer science is well-suited for cultur ally relev ant learning experiences giv en the
increasingly digital world of toda y’s learners. Examples of en vironments, initiativ es, and
activities that tak e adv antage of this fact includes Scr atch which allows users to add their
own pictures, allowing for personalization of projects, while App In ventor allows learners
to write progr ams for smart phones, so the progr ams students author can be carried with
them in their pock ets. Code.org tak es a different approach to cultur ally relev ant
instruction b y partnering with major entertainment properties, allowing learners to write
progr ams controlling Elsa from Disney’ s Froz en, BB -8 from Star W ars, or creating their
own v ersions of popular games lik e Flapp y Bird and Minecr aft. Another approach for
engaging div erse audience in cultur ally relev ant and personally meaning computer
science is to mo ve away from the laptops and desktops and bring computer science into
the world of cr afting and Making (Blikstein, 2013; Buechley & P erner -Wilson, 2012;
Holbert, 2016; Searle & K afai, 2015). Y et another approach for the creation of cultur ally
relevant computer science learning is to situate computing ideas within activities related
to creating and manipulating media. The Media Computation course dev eloped at Georgia
Tech Univ ersity introduces learners to progr amming b y manipulating images, video and
audio files and has been found effectiv ely engage and retain broad populations of learners
in computing learning opportunities (F orte & Guz dial, 2004). Collectiv ely, cultur ally
relevant computing instructing, be it b y situating learning in media, social settings, or in
the world of the learner bey ond the screen has been found to impro ve learning, retention,
and engagement with computing.","to Date
Year 1 (2017-2018):
- The initial v ersions of the Scr atch Encore instructional materials were dev eloped.
- A subset of these materials w as tested in 3 CPS classrooms. Informal classroom visits
were conducted and feedback w as gathered from these lead teachers classrooms. This
feedback informed the revision of the existing instructional materials and the
development of the remaining modules.
Year 2 (2018-2019):
- Professional Dev elopment tr aining sessions were offered to all teachers interested in
learning more about the Scr atch Encore curriculum. 31 CPS teachers receiv ed
professional dev elopment on best pr actices in teaching computer science and were
introduced to the Scr atch Encore materials.
- 8 teachers participated in a pilot study of the Scr atch Encore materials. Informal
classroom visits were conducted and feedback w as gathered from these 8 lead teacher
classrooms. In addition, researchers collected student worksheets and reviewed Scr atch
progr amming projects. W e are currently analyzing student work to see how well the
completed artifacts (e.g. , Scratch projects, worksheets) align with the lesson goals. All of
this information is being used to inform further revision to the materials. Early analysis
shows:
- Teachers were enthusiastically positiv e about the curriculum.
- Students learned sev eral CT pr actices through the curriculum.
- TIPP&SEE learning str ategy w as useful in creating classroom routines and k eeping
students on tr ack.
- Automated feedback tool would be ev en more useful in helping teachers k eep tr ack of
student progress.
The Use-Modif y-Create pedagogical approach w as successful in pro viding a balance
between structured tasks (use/modif y) that encour aged specific content learning and
open-ended tasks (create) that allowed students to personaliz e their learning and express
themselv es creativ ely. In addition, we found that ha ving a starter project significantly
reduced the lev el of personalization and creativit y displa yed by students, so we ha ve
largely remo ved those from the curriculum mo ving forw ard.
Year 3 (2019-2020):
- Professional Dev elopment tr aining sessions were offered to all teachers interested in
learning more about the Scr atch Encore curriculum. 27 CPS teachers receiv ed
professional dev elopment on best pr actices in teaching computer science and were
introduced to the Scr atch Encore materials.
- 10 teachers participated in a pilot study of the Scr atch Encore materials. Informal
classroom visits were conducted and feedback w as gathered from 9 teachers.
- Covid 19 ended the pilot study earlier than anticipated. In addition, we ha ve been
unable to pick up worksheets from man y classrooms.
- We have begun analyzing data we ha ve, but we ha ve too little data to ha ve results at
this time.
Year 4 (2020-2021):
- Online Professional Dev elopment tr aining sessions were offered to all teachers
interested in learning more about the Scr atch Encore curriculum.
- We have begun analyzing data from the PD . Our analysis shows that the teachers
learned from the professional dev elopment and they showed increased positiv e attitudes
towards computer science. They also expressed positiv e sentiments about the design and
structure of professional dev elopment.
- We continued our analysis of the data from previous y ears.
Year 5 (2021-22):
- Online Professional Dev elopment tr aining sessions were offered to all teachers
interested in learning more about the Scr atch Encore curriculum through the edX
platform.
- We continued our analysis of the data from previous y ears.Year 6 (2022-23):
- Online Professional Dev elopment tr aining sessions were offered to all teachers
interested in learning more about the Scr atch Encore curriculum through the edX
platform.
- We plan to recruit teachers who teach Scr atch Encore (treatment participants) and
teachers who teach other middle school CS curriculum (control participants) to participate
this y ear.
- We plan to analyz e pre- and post - data from both the control and study participants.
- We will continue our analysis of the data from previous y ears and current y ear.
Preliminary Results to Date
Based on the results of a district -wide surv ey completed b y 68 K -8 teachers from across
the cit y of Chicago , we had gained insight into the current state of computer science in
elementary gr ades across a larger , decentr alized school district. Here is a brief summary
of findings:
Teachers reported an a verage of 4.1 y ears of CS teaching experience and 13.3 y ears of
overall teaching experience.
Overall, teachers who responded to the surv ey reported enjo ying teaching CS and believ e
their students also enjo y CS. Teachers also largely reported feeling supported b y their
administr ation.
A variety of tools/en vironments are used (o ver 28 mentioned) with Code.org, Scr atch,
and Ja va being the three most frequently cited b y teachers.
When ask ed about standards ISTE and CST A were most frequently mentioned (27 of the
68 teachers mentioned one or both of them).
Found that the Use->Modif y->Create pedagogical str ategy resulted in:
Many students utilizing blocks in their Create activities that were introduced in the Use-
>Modif y
Allowed flexibilit y for students to apply their own personal expression in their projects
Expose them to different cultures
Allow them to use creativit y in completing assignments
Both teachers and gr ade lev el had an effect on completion r ates of required tasks, with
teacher being a much larger component.
Preliminary finding (that needs more research) that a teacher pro viding a starting project
greatly affects the v ariation / creativit y that students emplo y in their project
Our findings on an analysis of virtual PD v ersus in-person PD rev eal sev eral important
post-pandemic design implications for future CS PD progr ams. First, the teachers' CS
knowledge and attitudes significantly increased in both cohorts. Second, there were no
significant differences in attitudes or achiev ement between the cohorts. Third, the
teachers in the virtual PD showed as good changes or better in attitude than those in a
prior in-person PD . Finally , both cohorts were largely positiv e about the change from a
few intensiv e PD da ys to a few hours a week for sev eral weeks, ev en as they joined from
vacations.
An analysis of teachers completing debugging activities during a virtual PD show that
teachers were successful in completing the debugging activities and differed in their
strategies for helping students based on their lev el of content knowledge
Early results on learning CS during a pandemic suggest that the tr ansition to virtual CS
learning had a low impact on the amount of curriculum co vered and student project
completion.
We found that more teachers were able to decompose a sequence of ev ents when using a
vertical diagr am. While teachers in both conditions were similarly able to describe v arious
CT concepts and aspects of TP ACK, more teachers using a v ertical diagr am made
connections between concepts, while more teachers using a horiz ontal diagr am described
concepts in isolation. W e hope this explor ation will spur future work into diagr ams as a
potential scaffold in K -8 computing education.Type of Request

Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the motivation,
design, and implications of the project.
This is a joint project between UChicago STEM Education and Chicago Public Schools
(CPS) to pro vide an actionable and empirically grounded answer to the following
question: “How can we create adv anced elementary Computer Science instructional
materials that v alue adv ancing equit y equally with student learning outcomes?” CPS and
UChicago ha ve created instructional materials that were piloted v ery successfully in the
2018-19 school y ear. We are continuing this study to answer the following specific
questions about the Scr atch Encore curriculum we created.
This is a combined observ ational and data collection request.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Overarching research questions from all y ears of the study:
ORQ1: How do URMiC (Underrepresented Minorit y in Computing) students respond to
these materials with respect to interest, learning gains, and engagement with the
material?
ORQ2: What lev el of CS understanding do students demonstr ate upon completion of
these materials? 
ORQ3: How do teachers respond to these instructional materials with respect to
confidence, interest in continuing to teach and extend the materials, and o verall attitudes
towards computer science?
ORQ4: Do these instructional materials meet the needs of both the district and individual
schools with respect to flexibilit y, coherence, and ease of adoption?Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is
the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body
of extant knowledge?
Elementary Computer Science Education
While tr aditionally a subject for high school and bey ond, there is growing demand for
bringing CS into K -8 classrooms. Early work on progr amming as a means for learning
conducted b y Papert and colleagues with the Logo language found that progr amming w as
accessible to y ounger learners and could serv e as a powerful pedagogical str ategy (Harel
& Papert, 1990; P apert, 1980; P apert, W att, diSessa, & W eir, 1979). In this early work,
progr amming w as framed as a w ay to dev elop mathematical thinking as opposed to
formal computer science (P apert, 1972), but the underlying ideas where shared. In the
last decade, bringing CS to K -8 has grown in popularit y and has been facilitated b y
progr amming tools designed for y oung learners (Duncan, Bell, & T animoto , 2014;
Kelleher & P ausch, 2005). An increasingly popular approach for creating engaging and
accessible progr amming en vironments is the gr aphical, blocks-based progr amming
interface. Led b y the popularit y of the Scr atch en vironment, blocks-based progr amming
tools allow users to use a dr ag-and-drop approach to constructing progr ams. Blocks-
based progr amming tools include scaffolds that mak e progr amming easier , including
limiting syntax errors, pro viding visual cues on how commands can be used, and
providing an easy w ay to browse a vailable commands (W eintrop & Wilensky , 2015).
Blocks-based progr amming interfaces has been used to creating a div erse arr ay of
progr amming en vironments and tools, including museum exhibits (Horn, Br ady, Hjorth,
Wagh, & Wilensky , 2014), libr aries for controlling robots (Millner & Baafi, 2011), and tools
for creating mobile applications (W olber, Abelson, Spertus, & Looney , 2011).
While the groundswell of support for CS education has helped spur the creation of a
growing number of progr amming en vironments for y ounger learners, that ex citement has
resulted in a relativ ely small number of CS curricula designed for elementary classrooms.
This is in part due to the fact that en vironments lik e Scratch were not initially designed
for classrooms, instead focusing on informal spaces lik e afterschool progr ams (Maloney ,
Peppler , Kafai, R esnick, & R usk, 2008) and placed an emphasis on self -directed learning
and online collabor ation (Maloney , Resnick, R usk, Silv erman, & Eastmond, 2010; R oque,
Kafai, & Fields, 2012). Current elementary CS curricula include the F oundations for
Advancing Computational Thinking (F ACT) curriculum (Gro ver, Pea, & Cooper , 2015) and
the Creativ e Computing curriculum dev eloped b y Brennan and the Scr atchEd team. There
is also a growing libr ary of curricula designed for early elementary learning created using
specially designed progr amming en vironments, lik e the KELP-CS curriculum and LaPla ya
progr amming en vironment (Hill, Dwy er, Martinez, Harlow , & Fr anklin, 2015). Currently
these curricula are all intended to serv e as a students’ first introductory to CS in a formal
context. There is no widely used curriculum designed to serv e as an adv anced CS course
for elementary learners, a gap this proposal intends to address. Instead, teachers search
online for resources from v enues lik e ScratchEd and then adapt them to their needs,
schools purchase closed packages, or teachers create their own. All three options are ill-
suited to teachers with little experience in computing.
Culturally Relevant Computer Science Curricula
A major contribution of the field of Learning Science is the recognition that aligning
content with the culture, prior experience, and social v alues and norms of the learner can
yield powerful learning outcomes (C. D . Lee, 2007; Moll, Amanti, Neff , & Gonzalez, 1992;
Nasir, Rosebery , Warren, & Lee, 2006; R ogoff, 2003). Examples of cultur ally responsiv e
curricula can be found across math (Nasir , Hand, & T aylor, 2008), science (Erickson &
Gutierrez, 2002), and English language arts (C. D . Lee, 2001). R esponding to this
literature, in recent y ears, the same has become true for computer science. A notable
example of this is the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum, which w as designedto engage div erse high school students with CS topics through hands-on, cultur ally
relevant instruction (R yoo, Margolis, Lee, Sando val, & Goode, 2013). It accomplishes this
goal b y framing “CS learning around [students’] own questions and interests, cultur ally
relevant pedagogy dr awing on students’ funds of knowledge, and core CS concepts
relating to our ev eryday uses of new technology and participatory media” (R yoo et al. ,
2013, pp . 4–5).
Computer science is well-suited for cultur ally relev ant learning experiences giv en the
increasingly digital world of toda y’s learners. Examples of en vironments, initiativ es, and
activities that tak e adv antage of this fact includes Scr atch which allows users to add their
own pictures, allowing for personalization of projects, while App In ventor allows learners
to write progr ams for smart phones, so the progr ams students author can be carried with
them in their pock ets. Code.org tak es a different approach to cultur ally relev ant
instruction b y partnering with major entertainment properties, allowing learners to write
progr ams controlling Elsa from Disney’ s Froz en, BB -8 from Star W ars, or creating their
own v ersions of popular games lik e Flapp y Bird and Minecr aft. Another approach for
engaging div erse audience in cultur ally relev ant and personally meaning computer
science is to mo ve away from the laptops and desktops and bring computer science into
the world of cr afting and Making (Blikstein, 2013; Buechley & P erner -Wilson, 2012;
Holbert, 2016; Searle & K afai, 2015). Y et another approach for the creation of cultur ally
relevant computer science learning is to situate computing ideas within activities related
to creating and manipulating media. The Media Computation course dev eloped at Georgia
Tech Univ ersity introduces learners to progr amming b y manipulating images, video and
audio files and has been found effectiv ely engage and retain broad populations of learners
in computing learning opportunities (F orte & Guz dial, 2004). Collectiv ely, cultur ally
relevant computing instructing, be it b y situating learning in media, social settings, or in
the world of the learner bey ond the screen has been found to impro ve learning, retention,
and engagement with computing.Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated with
this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will be
asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
For the 2022-2023 school y ear: P articipating teachers and students in our study group
will engage in the curricular materials we ha ve created as part of their normally
scheduled class. 
The teachers participating in the study will complete the T eacher R egistr ation Surv ey, the
Teacher Demogr aphics Surv ey, and the T eachers’ A ttitudes T owards Computers
Questionnaire prior to teaching their curriculum (Study condition teachers: Scr atch
Encore curriculum, control teachers: other CS curriculum). T eachers will complete the
Teachers’ A ttitudes T owards Computers Questionnaire again after completing their
curriculum.
For both the study and control participants, we will obtain assent from all students and
active consent from all their parents. Only students with both assent and consent will be
participants in the research. Others not participating, will be in the classroom as normal,
but researchers will not collect data about these students' use of the materials (collecting
and analyzing worksheets and surv eys).
For our study and control participants, parents will complete a brief demogr aphic surv ey
about their child. This surv ey will include basic demogr aphic information about the child
including age, gr ade, r ace, school, parent ’s educational background, gender , and
background with computing and math. 
For our study and control participants, students will be ask ed to complete the
“Elementary School Coding A ttitudes Surv ey” surv ey to measure their attitudes about
computer science. Students will complete this surv ey both prior to beginning and upon
completion of the Scr atch Encore modules.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
These materials are being dev eloped as part of a R esearcher -Practitioner P artnership
(RPP) in collabor ation with Chicago Public Schools. Each y ear, we offer tr ainings to all
teachers interested in learning about the Scr atch Encore curriculum and it's structure and
pedagogy . Only a small subset of the teachers that attend the professional dev elopment
training will participate in the research study . Most teachers that attend the tr aining are
expected to adopt Scr atch Encore as their upper elementary / middle gr ades computer
science curriculum (independent of being in our research study).  The CS4All team at CPS
has encour aged teachers in elementary and middle school to consider using the Scr atch
Encore activities as their computer science curriculum. If requested, our team can get a
letter of support from Chicago Public Schools / CS4All.
We will use mix ed methods analytical techniques to analyz e the data. Statistical tests will
be run on the multiple choice surv ey and questionnaire data and qualitativ e techniques
will be used to analyz e more open-ended questions from the surv eys."

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
This study addresses two challenges: high school failure and the need to
make theory - and evidence-based dropout prev ention progr ams usable and
feasible in the classroom. This Institute of Education Sciences (IES)-funded
study will test the efficacy of a teacher -led, interv ention called Pathways to
Success (Pathways ). Pathways is the result of our Goal 2 dev elopment gr ant
in partnership with CPS , which tr anslated the tr ainer-led School-to- Jobs
interv ention—grounded in identity-based motivation (IBM) theory , and
proven effectiv e in a prior r andomiz ed study —into a usable, feasible, and
sustainable eighth-gr ade teacher -led interv ention. IBM predicts that children
achiev e better educational outcomes when they feel connected to who they
might become in the future and interpret challenges with schoolwork as
implying that schoolwork is important for attaining their desired future
selves. Forty-three CPS elementary schools and eighth-gr ade teachers and
guidance counselors were recruited and assigned b y lottery to implement
Pathways in either the 2019–20 school y ear (treatment) or 2020–21 school
year (dela yed treatment, now dela yed to 2021–22 due to COVID-19). Thirt y
additional CPS elementary schools and eighth-gr ade teachers and guidance
counselors were recruited and assigned b y lottery to implement P athways in
either the 2022–23 school y ear (treatment) or 2023–24 school y ear
(delayed treatment). The AIR research team will assess fidelit y of
implementation, seek feedback from teachers and students, and follow a
cohort of eighth-gr ade students through high school and bey ond using
administr ative data pro vided via AIR ’s master data-sharing agreement with
CPS to assess impact.
Our prior Goal 2 dev elopment gr ant (R305A140281) addressed the challenge
of creating a scalable STJ interv ention, mo ving from outside tr ainers—
trained through a univ ersity—to a teacher -led, teacher -trained Pathways
interv ention for sustainable implementation. In our Goal 2 gr ant, we
iteratively refined and tested the Pathways  model and implementation
resources following feedback from Chicago teachers and our own
observ ation of tr aining and interv ention deliv ery (coded from video
observ ation). First, we simplified instructions so that a teacher alone r ather
than a pair of tr ainers could deliv er the interv ention to a full classroom.
Second, we dev eloped sustainable materials to implement each activit y,
requiring little-to-no continued costs of implementation for teachers or
schools. Third, we dev eloped a clear oper ationalization of what qualit y
delivery looks lik e in each session to facilitate teacher learning. F ourth, we
created sensitiv e, qualit y-of-deliv ery fidelit y measures that can be reliably
coded from video recordings. Fifth, we created a website for teachers,
including the implementation manual, all handouts, P owerP oint presentation,
and three t ypes of video for each session (session, theory , and core point).
Session  videos show session-b y-session deliv ery of Pathways  to a full class
of Chicago public school children with text la yover to highlight qualit y of
delivery; although full half -hour sessions are presented, the video is sped up
so it can be viewed in 5–10 minutes. Theory videos highlight session-b y-
session k ey elements of IBM in the relev ant chunk for that session. Corepoint videos highlight session-b y-session tak e-home points and prep ideas
from teacher -trainers. Sixth, we produced a set of mini- video clips (1–3
minutes in dur ation each) that articulate in clear , everyday language the
underlying theory and how it relates to specific activities and points to
reinforce. These are used in the tr aining and pro vided again as learning
tools. Sev enth, we conducted the same iter ative process for the tr ainer
manual so that tr ainers ha ve a manual and relev ant video clips, P owerP oint
presentation, and handouts.
Findings from this dev elopment gr ant showed that teachers can implement
Pathways with moder ate to high fidelit y, closely par alleling implementation
fidelit y from the Oyserman and colleagues (2006) RCT in Detroit (dosage
and adherence a veraged 89% and 75%, respectiv ely, for Pathways in
Chicago v ersus 88% and 75%, respectiv ely, for STJ in Detroit). As a
guidepost, Durlak and DuPre’ s (2008) meta- analytic synthesis shows that
most educational interv entions with demonstr ated positiv e impacts attain
60% or higher fidelit y, and notes that few studies attain lev els greater than
80% when implemented b y practitioners. Our prior dev elopment study w as
not designed to pro vide a rigorous test of outcomes but fidelit y of
implementation positiv ely predicted student course performance (GP A,
reduced lik elihood of failure), controlling for prior y ear outcomes (Horowitz,
Sorensen, et al. , 2018). The current IES-funded efficacy study mo ves this
work forw ard by conducting a rigorous, 70-school test of efficacy for
impro ving student outcomes in high school and bey ond.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.

1.     What is the impact of Pathways  on student outcomes, including:
Identit y-based motiv ation in gr ade 8?
Self-regulatory beha viors and academic performance in gr ades 8 and
throughout high school?
Persistence (continuous enrollment) and progress (credits earned)
throughout high school?
On-tr ack (to gr aduate) status at the end of each y ear in high school
and 4- and 5- year high school gr aduation r ates?
Enrollment and persistence in postsecondary education?
2.     T o what extent do the impacts of Pathways differ across schools and
student subgroups?
3.     T o what extent do schools in the interv ention condition implement
Pathways with fidelit y?
4.     What is the per -pupil cost associated with implementing Pathways ?
Our theory of change predicts that teacher -led implementation of Pathways
will increase the core activ e ingredients of identit y-based motiv ation,
including students’ possible identities and str ategies to attain them and
interpretations of difficult y. Identit y-based motiv ation, in turn, facilitates
self-regulatory beha viors (time spent on homework, attendance,
initiativ e/beha vior in class), resulting in better academic outcomes (fewer
course failures, higher GP A, higher test scores, greater credits earned,
greater lik elihood of on-time gr aduation and postsecondary enrollment)","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Nearly one in fiv e Americans does not gr aduate from high school ev en
though high school on-time gr aduation r ates reached 83 percent, the highest
level in U .S. history , during the 2014–15 school y ear (U .S. Department of
Education, 2017). Moreo ver, risk of dropout disproportionally affects
economically disadv antaged, poor , rural, urban, Black, Hispanic, and
American Indian y outh (U .S. Department of Education, 2017). F or example,
as man y as half of students from low -income households (Archiv es for
Children T rends Database, 2013; Johnson, Str ange, & Madden, 2010) and
one in four Black y outh fails to gr aduate (U .S. Department of Education,
2017). The gr aduation r ate in Chicago , the setting for this study , has
increased in recent y ears to 74 percent, though it remains lower than the
national a verage and is consistently lower than the national a verage for
minorit y youth; 62 percent of Black males gr aduated from high school in
Chicago in 2014 (Allensworth et al. , 2016).
Dropout is a serious problem; it limits future prospects and dr ains public
resources. All but a tin y and shrinking proportion of jobs require a high
school diploma, and ev en if obtained, these jobs pa y less, accumulating to
more than $250,000 less lifetime earnings (L ynch, 2014). Dropouts dr aw
more on public funds than gr aduates both because they need more supports
(e.g., health, welfare) and because they are incarcer ated at higher r ates
(Chapman, Laird, Ifill, & K ewalRamani, 2011; Jordan, K ostandini, &
Mykerezi, 2012). Indeed, the a verage high school dropout will cost
taxpa yers more than $290,000 in lower tax rev enues, higher cash and in-
kind tr ansfer costs, and costs of incarcer ation (Sum et al. , 2009).
Dropout occurs for man y reasons but is usually a cumulativ e process of
increased disengagement with school (Fine, 1991; Orfield et al. , 2004). F or
three reasons, the middle school years offer a critical intervention
point at which dropout can be addressed . First, in Chicago , by the end
of ninth gr ade, it is possible to reliably identif y students at risk of not
graduating from high school (Allensworth, 2005, 2007). Second, a number
of simple criteria during middle school predict dropout: a failing gr ade in an
English or math class, an unsatisfactory beha vior mark in at least one class,
or attendance falling to 80 percent or lower (Balfanz, Herz ong, & MacIv er,
2007; Neild, Balfanz, & Herz og, 2007). Third, interv ening prior to ninth
grade is ideal as cumulativ e disengagement r arely results from students’
diminished desire to do well academically but r ather from a failure to
connect long-term future goals to immediate academic performance and
invest appropriate self -regulatory effort (Oyserman, 2012, 2015). Middle
school interv ention that mak es the future feel close (b y focusing students on
their future selv es) and school feel lik e the path to get there has been shown
to impro ve academic outcomes and reduce disengagement (Oyserman,
2012, 2015).
Designed for scalable and sustainable implementation, Pathways is a
teacher -led model of the tr ainer-led School-to- Jobs (STJ) interv ention. STJwas rigorously tested with a r andomiz ed controlled trial (RCT) in Detroit,
Michigan, which documented significant impact on student self -regulatory
behaviors (attendance, time spent on homework, student initiativ e,
disruptiv e beha vior) and academic outcomes—gr ade point a verage (GP A),
test scores, and retention (Oyserman, Bybee, & T erry, 2006). The RCT
tested and showed support for the theoretical fr amework: end of gr ade 8
effects persisted when examined at the end of gr ade 9, which is a critical
window for dropout prev ention, and effects were mediated b y changes in the
core “activ e ingredients” of identit y-based motiv ation.
Specifically , STJ demonstr ated substantial impro vements in important self -
regulatory beha viors (decreased unex cused absences [ d = -0.73], increased
time spent on homework [ d = 0.24], increased initiativ e in classroom
[teacher report, d = 0.17], and decreased disruptiv e beha viors [teacher
report, d= -0.21]) and k ey academic outcomes (core subject GP A, test
scores, retention) among low -income, at -risk eighth-gr ade students. These
significant effects persisted or grew larger across the tr ansition to high
school two y ears after the interv ention (end of ninth gr ade). F or example, at
the end of the first -year follow -up, fewer than half as man y interv ention
youths as control y ouths were retained in eighth gr ade and STJ
demonstr ated large effects on attendance. By the end of the second y ear of
follow -up, STJ students spent almost 70 percent more time on homework
each week than control students. Each semester , interv ention y outh
averaged 2.25 more da ys in school than control y outh, continuing the large
interv ention effect on attendance found at the end of the first y ear. A
significant difference in GP A emerged b y the third quarter ( d = 0.25), two
quarters after the interv ention, and that effect grew through the end of ninth
grade (see Oyserman et al. , 2006). Thus, this eighth-gr ade interv ention
administered in the beginning of the school y ear produced effects on critical
predictors of on-time gr aduation (Allensworth & Easton, 2005, 2007).
Empirical tests support the theory; STJ’ s direct effect on academic
performance w as mediated b y its effect on self -regulatory beha vior and IBM
core ingredients (Oyserman et al. , 2006). Effects are large enough to matter
in real- world settings; for example, they buffer students from the negativ e
effects of low parent in volvement with school (Oyserman, Brickman, &
Rhodes, 2007).","to Date
We have completed r andom assignment of a total of 73 schools across two
cohorts. Specifically , 43 Cohort 1 schools were r andomly assigned to a
treatment group (N=22 schools) that receiv ed Pathways to Success tr aining
in summer 2019 and implemented in fall 2019, or to a dela yed-treatment
group (N=21 schools) that receiv ed virtual tr aining in summer 2021 and
implemented in fall 2021 with their 8th gr ade students. A total of 30 Cohort
2 schools were r andomly assigned to a treatment group (N=15 schools) that
receiv ed training in summer 2022 and implemented in fall 2022, or to a
delayed-treatment group (N=15 schools) that receiv ed training in summer
2023 and implemented in fall 2023. W e have completed all primary data
collection (surv eys, video recordings). W e are following students through
Grade 10 and currently completing analyses.Preliminary Results to Date
We are currently in the process of gener ating final impact estimates o verall
and b y cohort. Currently , our analyses of fidelit y indicate that almost all
teachers that receiv ed training were able to successfully implement
Pathways with 60% or greater fidelit y--an empirically v alidated threshold
that has demonstr ated positiv e impacts for students.

Info from our appro ved application:
Data sources include extant administr ative records; surv eys of students,
teachers, and guidance counselors, if applicable; and video observ ations of
teachers. All data will be deidentified prior to analysis. W e describe each
data source below .
Extant Data
AIR will obtain student extant administr ative data from CPS for students
enrolled in eighth gr ade in participating schools following students from
Grades 7 (baseline), through the interv ention y ear in 8th gr ade and through
high school. These data are obtained via AIR ’s master data-sharing
agreement with CPS and a separ ate scope of work appro ved per procedures
outlined in that data-sharing agreement. Howev er, we briefly outline the
extant data to be collected here to pro vide broader context for the study .
Will collect student outcome data (GP A, course gr ades, standardiz ed test
scores, credit completion), attendance, and enrollment for each quarter or
semester period for gr ades 7–12 and 4- year and 5- year gr aduation
outcomes for Cohort 1 (students in 8th gr ade in 2019-20) and Cohort 2
(students in 8th gr ade in 2022-23). T o the extent possible, we also will
request information on student enrollment and persistence in postsecondary
education. In addition, AIR will obtain demogr aphic information (gender ,
race/ethnicit y, eligibilit y for free or reduced-price lunch, English learner ,
diverse learner) from gr ade 7. These data will be obtained for all
participating students (in treatment and control schools).
Student Surv ey Data
We will administer a 20-30 minute surv ey at the start and end of the school
year for 8th gr ade students in Cohorts 1 and 2, all participating students will
complete a web-based surv ey that assesses k ey components of the
interv ention (students’ imagined possible selv es, str ategies for obtaining
them, interpretations of difficult y on school-related tasks), self -regulatory
behaviors (self -reported absences, beha vior, time spent on homework), and
social and emotional well-being. In addition, at the end of the interv ention,
students from treatment schools will complete a 5-10 minute student
feedback surv ey. Students will be ask ed to r ate the qualit y of their
experience participating in the interv ention, as well as their confidence in
doing the things they pr acticed in each session. All surv eys will be web-
based and administered during a period that works best for each school.
Teacher Surv ey Data
All eighth-gr ade teachers (and guidance counselors) from treatment schools
will complete the following web-based surv eys: a feedback surv ey at the end
of a three-da y summer tr aining; a student participation form at the end of
each of twelv e interv ention sessions and an implementation feedback surv ey
at the end of the implementation period. When dela yed-treatment schools
implement schools implement P athways they will complete the same
surveys.Recruitment for the study is now complete.

Teacher Video Observ ations of Implementation
Teachers will record 12 P athways sessions for the research team to v alidate
fidelit y of implementation at scale and to support continuous impro vement
of progr am materials in Chicago . Teachers are pro vided an easy to use
GoPro camer a and AIR staff will retriev e memory cards and camer as from
teachers. Videos will focus on teacher deliv ery only . Using video-recordings
for research purposes only poses minimal disclosure risk. All video
recordings will be tr ansferred from the recording device to a secure serv er
only accessible to the study team.
Videos will be r ated b y trained observ ers to assess fidelit y of implementation
using a battery of v alid and reliable measures incorpor ated into previous
Pathways studies in Chicago .
In consultation with Sar ah Dickson and the CPS legal department, we
revised our video-recording consent approach. A t the start of this project,
we did not require consent for video-recording because videos and
associated coding focus on teachers, not students. W e learned in fall 2021
that CPS has previously changed its gener al video consent requirements. W e
worked with the CPS legal department to dev elop a new consent form that
will go home on the first da y of school in participating schools outlining the
purpose of P athways video-recording of teachers. P arents ha ve the
opportunit y to return the form b y an established date prior to P athways
implementation indicating that they do not w ant their child to be on video-
recordings while participating in P athways. Teachers will ha ve students
whose parents return these forms participate in P athways in a part of the
room not captured b y the video-recording device. This ""middle ground""
approach w as necessary to be able to finish the current gr ant in Chicago
Public Schools. Sar ah Dickson reported on F ebruary 16, 2022 b y email to PI
Nick Sorensen that our attached consent forms were appro ved by Legal.
These new forms will be incorpor ated into P athways implementation in fall
2022.
Does this involve video, audio, or
photograph recording?
Yes 
Please note: Video/Audio classroom
observations where students are
present is not permitted unless
every student present for the
observation has active assent and
parental consent. 
Please describe the protocol for audio/video recording
To validate high-qualit y implementation at scale in Chicago , we code dosage,
adherence, and qualit y of deliv ery using the attached, v alid and reliable
measures of implementation. These implementation measures ha ve been
used in multiple studies in Chicago and elsewhere and importantly predict
student outcomes.Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
Teachers record their own sessions; they store camer as in secure, lock ed
closets or dr awers while implementing P athways. AIR staff tr ansfer data from
memory cards to secure, encrypted, password protected hard driv es. Files on
the hard driv es are de-identified and copied to pcloud-- a secure cloud
storage service that ex ceeds CPS data securit y requirements (reviewed and
appro ved by AIR's Chief Information Securit y officer . The cloud stor age
allows us to share files with coders who can code the files (but not download,
copy etc.) from their respectiv e work locations. When coding is complete, all
files are remo ved from the secure cloud stor age. The hard driv es containing
the original files are stored in a lock ed file cabinet in a lock ed office, only
accessible to the Principal In vestigator .
How will you protect individuals who did not consent to participate in
the observation, and what will non-consented students be doing
during the observation(s)? 
Students whose parents declined permission for them to be included on video
were able to participate in P athways activities in a part of the classroom not
captured b y the video-recording device.

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
This study addresses two challenges: high school failure and the need to
make theory - and evidence-based dropout prev ention progr ams usable and
feasible in the classroom. This Institute of Education Sciences (IES)-funded
study will test the efficacy of a teacher -led, interv ention called Pathways to
Success (Pathways ). Pathways is the result of our Goal 2 dev elopment gr ant
in partnership with CPS , which tr anslated the tr ainer-led School-to- Jobs
interv ention—grounded in identity-based motivation (IBM) theory , and
proven effectiv e in a prior r andomiz ed study —into a usable, feasible, and
sustainable eighth-gr ade teacher -led interv ention. IBM predicts that children
achiev e better educational outcomes when they feel connected to who they
might become in the future and interpret challenges with schoolwork as
implying that schoolwork is important for attaining their desired future
selves. Forty-three CPS elementary schools and eighth-gr ade teachers and
guidance counselors were recruited and assigned b y lottery to implement
Pathways in either the 2019–20 school y ear (treatment) or 2020–21 school
year (dela yed treatment, now dela yed to 2021–22 due to COVID-19). Thirt y
additional CPS elementary schools and eighth-gr ade teachers and guidance
counselors were recruited and assigned b y lottery to implement P athways in
either the 2022–23 school y ear (treatment) or 2023–24 school y ear
(delayed treatment). The AIR research team will assess fidelit y of
implementation, seek feedback from teachers and students, and follow a
cohort of eighth-gr ade students through high school and bey ond using
administr ative data pro vided via AIR ’s master data-sharing agreement with
CPS to assess impact.
Our prior Goal 2 dev elopment gr ant (R305A140281) addressed the challenge
of creating a scalable STJ interv ention, mo ving from outside tr ainers—
trained through a univ ersity—to a teacher -led, teacher -trained Pathways
interv ention for sustainable implementation. In our Goal 2 gr ant, we
iteratively refined and tested the Pathways  model and implementation
resources following feedback from Chicago teachers and our own
observ ation of tr aining and interv ention deliv ery (coded from video
observ ation). First, we simplified instructions so that a teacher alone r ather
than a pair of tr ainers could deliv er the interv ention to a full classroom.
Second, we dev eloped sustainable materials to implement each activit y,
requiring little-to-no continued costs of implementation for teachers or
schools. Third, we dev eloped a clear oper ationalization of what qualit y
delivery looks lik e in each session to facilitate teacher learning. F ourth, we
created sensitiv e, qualit y-of-deliv ery fidelit y measures that can be reliably
coded from video recordings. Fifth, we created a website for teachers,
including the implementation manual, all handouts, P owerP oint presentation,
and three t ypes of video for each session (session, theory , and core point).
Session  videos show session-b y-session deliv ery of Pathways  to a full class
of Chicago public school children with text la yover to highlight qualit y of
delivery; although full half -hour sessions are presented, the video is sped up
so it can be viewed in 5–10 minutes. Theory videos highlight session-b y-
session k ey elements of IBM in the relev ant chunk for that session. Corepoint videos highlight session-b y-session tak e-home points and prep ideas
from teacher -trainers. Sixth, we produced a set of mini- video clips (1–3
minutes in dur ation each) that articulate in clear , everyday language the
underlying theory and how it relates to specific activities and points to
reinforce. These are used in the tr aining and pro vided again as learning
tools. Sev enth, we conducted the same iter ative process for the tr ainer
manual so that tr ainers ha ve a manual and relev ant video clips, P owerP oint
presentation, and handouts.
Findings from this dev elopment gr ant showed that teachers can implement
Pathways with moder ate to high fidelit y, closely par alleling implementation
fidelit y from the Oyserman and colleagues (2006) RCT in Detroit (dosage
and adherence a veraged 89% and 75%, respectiv ely, for Pathways in
Chicago v ersus 88% and 75%, respectiv ely, for STJ in Detroit). As a
guidepost, Durlak and DuPre’ s (2008) meta- analytic synthesis shows that
most educational interv entions with demonstr ated positiv e impacts attain
60% or higher fidelit y, and notes that few studies attain lev els greater than
80% when implemented b y practitioners. Our prior dev elopment study w as
not designed to pro vide a rigorous test of outcomes but fidelit y of
implementation positiv ely predicted student course performance (GP A,
reduced lik elihood of failure), controlling for prior y ear outcomes (Horowitz,
Sorensen, et al. , 2018). The current IES-funded efficacy study mo ves this
work forw ard by conducting a rigorous, 70-school test of efficacy for
impro ving student outcomes in high school and bey ond.Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
This study tests the efficacy of the teacher -led Pathways interv ention b y
addressing the following research questions:
1.     What is the impact of Pathways  on student outcomes, including:
Identit y-based motiv ation in gr ade 8?
Self-regulatory beha viors and academic performance in gr ades 8 and
throughout high school?
Persistence (continuous enrollment) and progress (credits earned)
throughout high school?
On-tr ack (to gr aduate) status at the end of each y ear in high school
and 4- and 5- year high school gr aduation r ates?
Enrollment and persistence in postsecondary education?
2.     T o what extent do the impacts of Pathways differ across schools and
student subgroups?
3.     T o what extent do schools in the interv ention condition implement
Pathways with fidelit y?
4.     What is the per -pupil cost associated with implementing Pathways ?
Our theory of change predicts that teacher -led implementation of Pathways
will increase the core activ e ingredients of identit y-based motiv ation,
including students’ possible identities and str ategies to attain them and
interpretations of difficult y. Identit y-based motiv ation, in turn, facilitates
self-regulatory beha viors (time spent on homework, attendance,
initiativ e/beha vior in class), resulting in better academic outcomes (fewer
course failures, higher GP A, higher test scores, greater credits earned,
greater lik elihood of on-time gr aduation and postsecondary enrollment)Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Nearly one in fiv e Americans does not gr aduate from high school ev en
though high school on-time gr aduation r ates reached 83 percent, the highest
level in U .S. history , during the 2014–15 school y ear (U .S. Department of
Education, 2017). Moreo ver, risk of dropout disproportionally affects
economically disadv antaged, poor , rural, urban, Black, Hispanic, and
American Indian y outh (U .S. Department of Education, 2017). F or example,
as man y as half of students from low -income households (Archiv es for
Children T rends Database, 2013; Johnson, Str ange, & Madden, 2010) and
one in four Black y outh fails to gr aduate (U .S. Department of Education,
2017). The gr aduation r ate in Chicago , the setting for this study , has
increased in recent y ears to 74 percent, though it remains lower than the
national a verage and is consistently lower than the national a verage for
minorit y youth; 62 percent of Black males gr aduated from high school in
Chicago in 2014 (Allensworth et al. , 2016).
Dropout is a serious problem; it limits future prospects and dr ains public
resources. All but a tin y and shrinking proportion of jobs require a high
school diploma, and ev en if obtained, these jobs pa y less, accumulating to
more than $250,000 less lifetime earnings (L ynch, 2014). Dropouts dr aw
more on public funds than gr aduates both because they need more supports
(e.g., health, welfare) and because they are incarcer ated at higher r ates
(Chapman, Laird, Ifill, & K ewalRamani, 2011; Jordan, K ostandini, &
Mykerezi, 2012). Indeed, the a verage high school dropout will cost
taxpa yers more than $290,000 in lower tax rev enues, higher cash and in-
kind tr ansfer costs, and costs of incarcer ation (Sum et al. , 2009).
Dropout occurs for man y reasons but is usually a cumulativ e process of
increased disengagement with school (Fine, 1991; Orfield et al. , 2004). F or
three reasons, the middle school years offer a critical intervention
point at which dropout can be addressed . First, in Chicago , by the end
of ninth gr ade, it is possible to reliably identif y students at risk of not
graduating from high school (Allensworth, 2005, 2007). Second, a number
of simple criteria during middle school predict dropout: a failing gr ade in an
English or math class, an unsatisfactory beha vior mark in at least one class,
or attendance falling to 80 percent or lower (Balfanz, Herz ong, & MacIv er,
2007; Neild, Balfanz, & Herz og, 2007). Third, interv ening prior to ninth
grade is ideal as cumulativ e disengagement r arely results from students’
diminished desire to do well academically but r ather from a failure to
connect long-term future goals to immediate academic performance and
invest appropriate self -regulatory effort (Oyserman, 2012, 2015). Middle
school interv ention that mak es the future feel close (b y focusing students on
their future selv es) and school feel lik e the path to get there has been shown
to impro ve academic outcomes and reduce disengagement (Oyserman,
2012, 2015).
Designed for scalable and sustainable implementation, Pathways is a
teacher -led model of the tr ainer-led School-to- Jobs (STJ) interv ention. STJwas rigorously tested with a r andomiz ed controlled trial (RCT) in Detroit,
Michigan, which documented significant impact on student self -regulatory
behaviors (attendance, time spent on homework, student initiativ e,
disruptiv e beha vior) and academic outcomes—gr ade point a verage (GP A),
test scores, and retention (Oyserman, Bybee, & T erry, 2006). The RCT
tested and showed support for the theoretical fr amework: end of gr ade 8
effects persisted when examined at the end of gr ade 9, which is a critical
window for dropout prev ention, and effects were mediated b y changes in the
core “activ e ingredients” of identit y-based motiv ation.
Specifically , STJ demonstr ated substantial impro vements in important self -
regulatory beha viors (decreased unex cused absences [ d = -0.73], increased
time spent on homework [ d = 0.24], increased initiativ e in classroom
[teacher report, d = 0.17], and decreased disruptiv e beha viors [teacher
report, d= -0.21]) and k ey academic outcomes (core subject GP A, test
scores, retention) among low -income, at -risk eighth-gr ade students. These
significant effects persisted or grew larger across the tr ansition to high
school two y ears after the interv ention (end of ninth gr ade). F or example, at
the end of the first -year follow -up, fewer than half as man y interv ention
youths as control y ouths were retained in eighth gr ade and STJ
demonstr ated large effects on attendance. By the end of the second y ear of
follow -up, STJ students spent almost 70 percent more time on homework
each week than control students. Each semester , interv ention y outh
averaged 2.25 more da ys in school than control y outh, continuing the large
interv ention effect on attendance found at the end of the first y ear. A
significant difference in GP A emerged b y the third quarter ( d = 0.25), two
quarters after the interv ention, and that effect grew through the end of ninth
grade (see Oyserman et al. , 2006). Thus, this eighth-gr ade interv ention
administered in the beginning of the school y ear produced effects on critical
predictors of on-time gr aduation (Allensworth & Easton, 2005, 2007).
Empirical tests support the theory; STJ’ s direct effect on academic
performance w as mediated b y its effect on self -regulatory beha vior and IBM
core ingredients (Oyserman et al. , 2006). Effects are large enough to matter
in real- world settings; for example, they buffer students from the negativ e
effects of low parent in volvement with school (Oyserman, Brickman, &
Rhodes, 2007).Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
Teacher Training
The USC implementation team will lead multiple 3-da y teacher -led tr aining
sessions on Pathways across four y ears. Cohort 1 treatment schools receiv ed
training in summer 2019; Cohort 1 dela yed-treatment school receiv ed
training in summer 2021 (one y ear later than planned due to COVID-19).
Cohort 2 treatment schools will receiv e training in summer 2022 and Cohort
2 dela yed-treatment schools will receiv e training in summer 2023.
In the tr aining, teachers first will engage in Pathways  experiential activities
tailored for teachers to be able to experience the activ e ingredients for
themselv es; second, they will learn about the psy chological theory and
research supporting Pathways  via video-recorded segments from Dr .
Oyserman, followed b y facilitated discussion with teacher -trainers and
trainer-led activities to ensure in-depth engagement; third, they will learn
how to implement the curriculum and how to use the video resources and
step-b y-step implementation manual to prepare for each session; fourth,
they will lead implementation of at least one session and receiv e
individualiz ed coaching and feedback from teacher -trainers and their peers
and pro vide feedback to others; and, finally , they will be giv en time to ask
final wr ap-up questions. T eachers will be ask ed to participate in weekly 1-
hour videoconferences with a teacher -trainer during the interv ention period
to debrief an y challenges of implementation and prepare for sessions the
following week.
As part of tr aining, teachers and guidance counselors will be pro vided a cop y
of the Pathways  implementation manual and access to the video libr ary,
including clips of Dr . Oyserman implementing each session, with a focus on
key activities, as well as brief clips explaining the theoretical r ationale for
the design of each session, and clips from teacher -trainers pro viding tips for
prepar ation and implementation. T eachers and guidance counselors also will
be pro vided a set of all the sustainable materials needed for Pathways
activities. T eachers will be able to k eep these materials so that they can
continue to use them after the formal ev aluation period is complete;
implementation in subsequent y ears will require minimal prepar ation (e.g. ,
photocopies of handouts for each session— also a vailable as P owerP oint).
Implementation of Pathways to Success
Following the tr aining, participating teachers will implement Pathways  in the
fall twice per week o ver six weeks in homeroom or an advisory period. The
specific period in which the progr am will be implemented and its schedule
will be determined b y the school giv en the focus on making the progr am
feasible for implementation in schools. Below is a brief thumbnail sk etch of
each session. Activities are simple and seemingly “easy .” This w as
intentional, since ease and difficult y are used in metacognitiv e judgments ofexperience. If students found activities difficult, they would be at risk of
interpreting difficult y as meaning that thinking of the future is hard and “not
for me. ”
Session 1, Setting the Stage:  Students are paired up and briefly interview
one another on the skills or abilit y they each ha ve that will help them
complete the school y ear successfully (e.g. , “well organiz ed,” “positiv e
attitude”). Then each student introduces his or her interview partner in
terms of these skills. This pro vides an initial example of academic possible
identities being compatible with important social identities because all y outh
engage in the task; the tak e-home message is: “Y ou ha ve some skills and
abilities that help y ou in succeeding in the coming y ear and others do , too.”
Session 2, Adult Images:  Students pick photogr aphs that fit their adult
“visions” (their adult possible self ). Photogr aphs include the four domains of
adulthood: material (e.g. , home), job , relationships (e.g. , family , friends),
and communit y engagement. Photogr aphs include both genders and match
the racial-ethnic mak eup of the school. The tak e-home message is: “W e all
have images of ourselv es as adults in the far future. ” This implies that
important social identities are compatible with a future orientation.
Session 3, Positive and Negative Forces:  Students dr aw positiv e and
negativ e forces: people or things that pro vide energy to work tow ard their
possible identities and those that pro vide examples of what not to do or sa y.
The tak e-home message is: “P ositiv e forces help us la y out paths for success
and handling difficulties and setbacks; negativ e forces do the opposite b y
laying out paths for failure and examples for how not to handle difficulties
and setbacks. ”
Sessions 4 and 5, Timelines: Students dr aw timelines into the future,
including forks in the road and obstacles. Students start with the present so
all timelines in volve school. The tak e-home message is: “The future is a path
that has an order , even though there are forks and obstacles along the w ay.”
Sessions 6 and 7, Pathways to the Future: Students choose next -year
feared and to-be-expected possible selv es and link them with str ategies to
attain them. Then students choose adult possible selv es and link str ategies
to them, producing a concrete path from next -year possible selv es to adult
possible selv es via current actions (str ategies). The first tak e-home message
is: “Str ategies are actions y ou are taking now or could tak e to become y our
next y ear possible self .” The second is: “ Any strategies I’m doing (or could
be doing) now to get m y next -year possible self will also help me get to m y
adult possible self .”
Session 8, Action Paths:  Students pr actice articulating specific str ategies
to attain their academic possible identities using an easy -to-recall formula
(because … I will … when …), further highlighting that difficult y in attaining
academic possible selv es is normal. The tak e-home message is: “ Action
paths are more specific than path ways, they remind me of m y goal—m y
adult possible self —and link that to a time and place in which I will tak e
action to work tow ard it. ”
Sessions 9–11, Everyday Problems: Three sessions focus on(mis)interpretation of difficult y. Students start with puzzles, mo ve on to
academic problems, and end with high school gr aduation and college.
Problems are difficult. Students pr actice breaking problems into smaller
parts so that they can experience difficult y as meaning that effort can be
increased because the problem is important r ather than impossible to
resolv e. The tak e-home message is: “I can use the skills I learn in Pathways
to break up ev eryday problems and mak e progress more lik ely.”
Session 12, Wrapping Up and Moving Forward:  The final session
cements students’ new metacognitiv e interpretations b y having students
review the activities in order , critique them, and articulate in their own
words each session’ s point.
Data Collection Activities
Student surveys. All 8th gr ade students in participating schools will
complete a web-based surv ey that assesses k ey components of the
interv ention (students’ imagined possible selv es, str ategies for obtaining
them, interpretations of difficult y on school-related tasks), self -regulatory
behaviors (self -reported absences, beha vior, time spent on homework), and
social and emotional well-being. In addition, at the end of the interv ention,
students from the treatment schools will complete a student feedback
survey. Students will be ask ed to r ate the qualit y of their experience
participating in the interv ention, as well as their confidence in doing the
things they pr acticed in each session. T eachers will administer surv eys to
students to a void ha ving external people in the school building though this is
an easy process. Student data collection activities will be scheduled on a
day/time that is con venient for participating schools and teachers.
Teacher surveys.  All eighth-gr ade teachers (and guidance counselors)
from treatment schools will complete the following web-based surv eys: a
feedback surv ey at the end of a three-da y summer tr aining; a student
participation form the end of each of twelv e interv ention sessions; an
implementation feedback surv ey at the end of the implementation period;
and a sustainabilit y surv ey in the y ear following the first y ear of
implementation. Eighth-gr ade teachers in the dela yed-treatment schools will
implement the interv ention and will complete the same surv eys.
Video-observations. Implementing teachers will be ask ed to video-record
their 12 sessions. This does not require an y time on their part as the
camer as are easy to set up , they simply press power and record.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
Study Design
Cluster randomized controlled trial (CRT) . To test efficacy of Pathways ,
we will conduct a CR T involving pair -matched r andom assignment of 70+
schools to treatment or dela yed treatment (control). T reatment schools
participate in tr aining and implement Pathways  in gr ade 8 in the 2019–20
and 2022-23 school y ears for Cohort 1 and 2 respectiv ely. Dela yed-
treatment (control) schools participate in tr aining with a one- year lag
(summer 2021 for Cohort 1 due to COVID-19) and implement in the next
school y ears for Cohort 1 and 2 respectiv ely. The CPS teachers who
implemented Pathways with the highest fidelit y in our Goal 2 gr ant will serv e
as teacher -trainers for our Goal 3 efficacy study . They will tr ain, on a verage,
two to three teachers and one or more guidance counselors in each school,
for an estimated total of at least 168 eighth-gr ade teachers and at least 70
guidance counselors (half treatment, half dela yed treatment). W e dev eloped,
refined, and finaliz ed (collabor atively with CPS schools and teachers)
training and implementation manuals and video resources in our Goal 2
development gr ant.
Eighth-gr ade teachers and guidance counselors in treatment schools will
participate in about 20 hours of tr aining o ver 3 da ys and 6 one-hour weekly
check -ins with teacher -trainers while implementing Pathways  in fall Y ear 2 to
debrief and resolv e any challenges. The district has requested guidance
counselor tr aining for two reasons: to facilitate coherent support in and out
of the classroom and to co ver any classroom should a teacher unexpectedly
be unable to implement. T reatment group teachers will implement Pathways
in their classrooms twice a week for 6 weeks during their homeroom,
advisory , or a class period deemed appropriate b y each school’ s
administr ation. Schools r andomly assigned to dela yed treatment will
continue business- as-usual. Dela yed treatment group teachers and guidance
counselors receiv e the same tr aining and implementation support one y ear
later.
This study design allows us to assess the efficacy of the teacher -led,
teacher -trained Pathways interv ention in promoting students’ IBM, self -
regulatory beha viors, academic outcomes following the interv ention (RQ1),
and whether impacts differ across schools and student subgroups (RQ2).
Explor atory analyses will also test the theoretical process model.
Implementation study . The implementation study will assess the fidelit y
of implementation and cost of implementing Pathways  at greater scale in
Chicago . Fidelit y will be assessed in three w ays: the study team will code the
video-recorded session using the fidelit y assessments established in the
Detroit RCT and refined in our Goal 2 gr ant in Chicago . As before, each
teacher will be ask ed to complete a brief teacher surv ey to pro vide feedback
on implementation successes and challenges, and all students inparticipating classrooms in treatment schools will pro vide feedback on
implementing (teachers) and participating (students) in Pathways  via a brief
survey. Based on the dev elopment gr ant findings, we anticipate that
sessions will be implemented with fidelit y; howev er, we will examine natur al
variation, which reflects realistic implementation conditions (RQ3), as well as
whether outcomes for students in treatment schools is related to fidelit y of
implementation. W e will descriptiv ely examine sustainabilit y by documenting
the percentage of treatment schools that continue to implement Pathways  in
the second y ear, as well as reasons for continuing or discontinuing
implementation, assessed via a surv ey of lead teachers. Finally , we will
conduct a cost analysis to examine the per -pupil cost of implementing
Pathways  (RQ4).
Impact of  Pathways  on student-level outcomes. Our primary research
questions focus on the impact of Pathways  on student -level measures of
IBM, self -regulatory beha viors, and academic outcomes. Data for these
analyses are hier archical—students are nested within schools. Therefore, we
will use a two-lev el multilev el model (MLM) to ev aluate the impact of
Pathways  on student outcomes, with treatment effects modeled at the unit
of random assignment (Bloom, 2005; Donner & Klar , 2000; R audenbush,
1997). The MLM appropriately accounts for the non-independence of
students (Lev el 1) nested in schools (Lev el 2). W e do not plan to model
teacher -level effects because we cannot cleanly nest students in control
schools within an individual eighth-gr ade teacher for at least three reasons.
First, schools can elect to implement Pathways  in homeroom or an y period
they deem most appropriate—making it impossible to assign individual
control students to specific teachers without knowing which teacher would
have implemented Pathways for each student. Second, because instruction
in grade 8 is departmentaliz ed, students t ypically tak e at least one class with
all teachers serving students in gr ade 8. Third, in the small schools lik ely to
comprise a third of the sample, estimating teacher -level effects is
functionally equiv alent to estimating school-lev el effects because the school
has only one eighth-gr ade teacher and sev enth-gr ade teachers teach some
subjects. Therefore, we test the school-lev el impact of Pathways  (Level 2).
[1] Because our goal in this Goal 3 efficacy study is to pro vide an internally
valid, unbiased estimate of the IT T effect of Pathways, the proposed impact
model assumes a constant treatment effect but will model school intercepts
as random effects. The model also includes binary indicators for matched-
pairs at Lev el 2 to capture the matched-pair r andom assignment.
Missing data. Our IT T approach and access to CPS district -wide
administr ative data allows us to examine outcomes for students in schools
randomly assigned to treatment or control, regardless of student mobilit y
within CPS . For analyses of student outcomes measured via a student
survey, we anticipate high response r ates (85 percent) since surv eys will be
administered in class. Howev er, to address potential bias associated with
missing data, we will use dumm y covariate adjustment and in verse
probabilit y weighting.  Sensitivit y analyses emplo ying multiple imputation
will examine whether findings are robust to missing data.  AIR has
successfully implemented both procedures on multiple IES-funded studies
emplo ying similar study designs (e.g. , Faria et al. , 2017, Heppen et al. ,
2016; Heppen et al. , 2012).[3]
[4]Moderation.  Although explor atory, we propose examining whether
particular subgroups of students benefited more from participation
in Pathways  than other subgroups (RQ2). T o examine differences between
the subgroups, we will add a cross-lev el inter action term to the IT T model to
examine whether student -level individual differences moder ated the
treatment effect.
Mediation. The theory of change guiding the study is supported b y
extensiv e prior research and predicts that effects of Pathways on academic
outcomes are mediated partially or fully through increases in IBM and self -
regulatory beha viors. W e will examine these mediation h ypotheses using an
explor atory multilev el structur al equation model (MSEM). That is, we will
examine whether the direct effect of Pathways  on academic outcomes is
mediated b y differences in students’ IBM and self -regulatory beha viors in
treatment and controls schools. T reatment assignment is at the school lev el
(Level 2) and the mediators and outcomes are measured at the student lev el
(Level 1). Using MSEM instead of MLM addresses conflated within- and
between-effects that pose estimation problems in MLMs when testing cross-
level mediation (see Preacher , Zhang, & Z yphur , 2011).
Complier average causal effect (CACE) . We will supplement our IT T
analyses with CACE analyses for each outcome. CACE, also referred to as
“local a verage treatment effect ” (Angrist, Imbens, & R ubin, 1996;
Gennetian, Morris, Bos, & Bloom, 2005), represents the treatment effect on
those who comply with their treatment assignment (i.e. , compliers). CACE is
not treatment -on-the-treated (T OT), as the latter is the treatment effect on
both compliers and alw ays-tak ers—those who would receiv e treatment
regardless of treatment assignment. Because CACE captures the effect of
externally induced changes in the treatment receiv ed, the purpose of most
interv entions in the social sciences (Gennetian et al. , 2005), it is more policy
relevant than T OT.
We will estimate the effect of Pathways  on compliers using an instrumental
variable approach particularly well suited for CACE analysis in an
experimental context (Angrist et al. , 1996; Gennetian et al. , 2005; Schochet
& Chiang, 2009). Lottery -based pair -matched r andom assignment will be a
natur al instrument because the r andom assignment procedure is expected to
have a positiv e effect on school-lev el implementation of Pathways , and
implementation of Pathways  is likely to be the only plausible path through
which the r andom assignment procedure could impro ve student outcomes. It
is unlik ely that an y school consenting to participate in the study would
deliber ately do the opposite of the assignment receiv ed, regardless of
assignment. Thus, all three k ey assumptions under which the instrumental
variable approach produces an unbiased estimate for CACE (nonz ero causal
effect of treatment assignment on treatment receipt, ex clusion restriction,
and monotonicit y [no defiers]) are lik ely to hold.
Specifically , using the Stata progr am ivreg2  (Baum, Schaffer , & Stillman,
2010), we will obtain the predicted probabilit y of implementing Pathways
with moder ate or high fidelit y for each school based on a linear probabilit y
model. Specifically , we will estimate the probabilit y that each schoolachiev es at least moder ate lev els of implementation (see Implementation
fidelit y measures). This predicted probabilit y of school-lev el Pathways
implementation will be used to predict each student outcome. The equation
used to predict each student outcome will be similar to the main impact
model ex cept that the binary treatment indicator will be replaced with the
predicted probabilit y of school-lev el Pathways  implementation. The
coefficient for the predicted probabilit y of school-lev el Pathways
implementation with at least moder ate fidelit y represents the effect of
Pathways  on student outcomes for schools that comply with r andom
assignment.
Cost Analysis. Our cost analysis (RQ4) uses the R esource Cost Model
(RCM), which in volves the accounting of all ingredients needed to recreate
the interv ention in a new context (Chambers & P arrish, 1994). AIR has used
RCM successfully (e.g. , Hebbler , Levin, P erez, Lam, & Chambers, 2004,
2009; Levin, Chambers, Stapleton, DeLancey , & Segarr a, 2008; Somers et
al., 2010). F ollowing the established methods, we will identif y costs
associated with the start -up and ongoing implementation of Pathways ,
determining costs per -pupil and per -school. The Pathways  materials,
including video resources and implementation manuals, were refined and
made publically a vailable through our interv ention website during our prior
Goal 2 gr ant. Therefore, the cost to access and download the materials is
free to all schools and teachers. The RCM considers a r ange of other
potentially less apparent costs such as time and labor , materials, equipment,
and facilities needed to set up and deliv er the interv ention. RCM analysis
pays particular attention to the t ypes of required personnel and their salaries
and benefits. RCM analysis includes oper ating costs that are t ypically
aggregated across organizational units. The costs deriv ed through the
analysis are grouped according to their specific functions of launching and
sustaining Pathways . Costs are also scaled according to the number of
schools and students serv ed. Our cost analysis will occur after the treatment
group completes Pathways  implementation. The implementation team will
keep financial records through the ev aluation period and the ev aluation team
will seek information from school administr ators via post -implementation
surveys. P er-pupil and per -school expenditure information will be based on a
single urban school district; howev er, the district shares char acteristics with
other urban districts, and the sample of schools represents lik ely end-users
of Pathways .
[1] Within treatment schools we can link students to a specific Pathways
teacher so will examine between-teacher , within-school v ariance in
outcomes, and in consultation with our senior methodological and statistical
advisors, consider including sensitivit y analyses to test whether impact
estimates are robust to modeling alternativ e nesting structures (e.g. ,
partially nested design following Lohr , Schochet & Sanders, 2014).
[2] To account for the possibilit y that analyses of multiple measures could
inflate significance estimates, we use the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. W e
follow What W orks Clearinghouse recommendations to correct for multiple
comparisons in the same outcome domain. T o minimiz e alpha inflation, we
will work with our technical advisor K urki to finaliz e alignment of measuresand domains to determine appropriate adjustments for multiple comparisons
 We will use dumm y variable adjustment for analyses, including mean
imputation for continuous co variates (see Puma, Olsen, Bell, & Price, 2009).
Because treatment assignment is r andomiz ed, missing co variate data should
not affect the impact estimate. W e will apply in verse probabilit y weights to
cases with missing outcome data to account for potential nonresponse bias
and impro ve our abilit y to gener alize results to the target study population
(Ridgew ay, McCaffrey , Morr al, Griffin, & Burgette, 2013; W ooldridge, 2007).
The in verse probabilit y weight will be based on students’ predicted
probabilities of ha ving data for a giv en outcome, with predicted probabilities
estimated using a gener alized boosted regression (McCaffrey , Ridgew ay, &
Morral, 2004).
 We will use Multiple Imputation with Chained Equations (MICE) to impute
values for missing data for multiple imputation sensitivit y analyses. MICE
assumes that missingness is r andom (termed missing conditionally at
random [MCAR) when all of the relationships between observ ed data
(student char acteristics, high school gr ade point a verage, and institution
characteristics) and missingness are accounted for (Gr aham, 2009).
Following Puma et al. (2009), imputation will be conducted separ ately for
treatment and control."

Metropolitan F amily Services' Communit y Schools progr amming benefited a
total of 2,774 students across 18 Chicago Public Schools and two suburban
schools in FY24. The objectiv e of this progr amming is to broaden the
horizons and enhance the educational achiev ements of y outh b y offering a
range of services. These services include tutoring, homework assistance,
recreational activities, life skills workshops, cultur al experiences, and case
management services. They are primarily targeted at students in schools
facing significant academic challenges. Among the 2,774 students who
participated, they were divided as follows: 49% male and 51% female; 1%
in pre-kindergarten, 50% in K -5th gr ade, 32% in 6th-8th gr ade, and 18% in
9th-12th gr ade; the ethnic breakdown w as 64% Latinx, 33% Black/African
American, and 3% Caucasian.
Metropolitan F amily Services emplo ys various methods to assess student
engagement and participation in activities, as well as their progress in
different subject areas. These methods encompass surv eys conducted with
students, parents, and teachers, as well as tr acking individual student
participation hours. Data gathered from satisfaction surv eys indicates a high
level of satisfaction with the progr am, both among students and parents.
Students expressed their appro val of the div erse r ange of after -school
activities offered in the progr am and their gr atitude for the activit y
instructors. The Communit y Schools progr amming offers a wide arr ay of
activities aimed at equipping students with essential life skills and social-
emotional competencies. Among these, students highlighted their
achiev ements in team work, communit y building, and social-emotional
development.
The progr am's div erse subject offerings, including computer science,
engineering, art, and contact sports, were also highly r ated b y students.
Parents reported high satisfaction with the progr amming, emphasizing that it
provides v aluable learning opportunities and a safe communal space for their
children after school. Adult progr amming within the Communit y Schools
progr am has also been well-receiv ed by parents, who noted that it fosters a
relaxed en vironment where their interests and opinions are v alued. This
evaluation sheds light on the areas where Communit y Schools progr amming
effectiv ely engages students, parents, and teachers in understanding its
positiv e impact on social-emotional learning that can lead to academic
success. The surv ey results highlight both areas for impro vement and
successful aspects, as reported b y parents, students, and teachers.
In years prior , the research team would request student, gr ade-lev el data to
demonstr ate academic impro vements. Howev er, limited data w as receiv ed
and could not be accur ately analyz ed. Researchers are shifting to focus on
the dev elopment of student social-emotional competencies through the
completion of the DES SA-mini. R esearch shows the benefits of social-
emotional learning ma y impro ve a student's attitude about themselv es,
school, and others which can positiv ely impact academic performance.
Students with higher social-emotional competencies show to ha ve fewer
conduct problems, less aggressiv e beha vior, and decreased emotional
distress.Social-emotional dev elopment and attainment is measured in students using
the DES SA-mini social-emotional tool. The DES SA-mini is an 8-question
screener completed b y Communit y Schools progr am staff to r ate a student's
social-emotional competency . This allows researchers to note growth and
trends of SEL dev elopment of students during their enrollment in after -
school enrichment progr amming.

Please check all of the following that apply to your research protocol:
QuestionnairePlease outline your protocol for survey activities, describing when,
where, duration, frequency, and with whom.
During the first month of the school y ear, all students enrolled in communit y
school progr ams managed b y Metropolitan F amily Services will be giv en an
assent form and parent permission form b y a member of the research team
for consider ation. They will be giv en instructions on what to do with the
forms, what it means to be in the study (risks and benefits), and instruction
that participation in the progr am is v oluntary .
Second, Communit y Schools progr am staff will complete a DES SA-mini per
enrolled student 4-6 weeks after the first da y of progr amming each quarter
during the school y ear. The DES SA-mini is an 8-question screener completed
by Communit y Schools progr am staff to r ate a student's social-emotional
competency . This allows researchers to note growth and trends of SEL
development in students during their enrollment in after -school enrichment
progr amming. R esearch shows the benefits of social-emotional learning ma y
impro ve a student's attitude about themselv es, school, and others which can
positiv ely impact academic performance. Students with higher social-
emotional competencies show to ha ve fewer conduct problems, less
aggressiv e beha vior, and decreased emotional distress.
Third, members from the research team will collect a communit y school
progr am satisfaction surv ey from all students who ha ve signed the assent
form and turned in signed parent permission forms. This is collected twice a
school y ear and first collected at the end of the fall quarter . The satisfaction
survey is designed to measure a students' attitudes about their in volvement
in the Communit y Schools progr am.
Fourth, during the last month of the school y ear, members from the research
team will collect a second communit y school progr am satisfaction surv ey
from all students enrolled in the study . This will help the researchers assess
the type of impact, if an y, that the communit y school progr am has on
student attitudes and if the students lik e the progr am. A t this time, research
staff will also collect a teacher's surv ey from CPS teachers who work with
the study participants and a parents' surv ey.
During each new subsequent school y ear, this cy cle of data collection will be
repeated with all new students who enroll into the study .
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The purpose of this study is to conduct a progr am ev aluation of all
Communit y Schools progr ams managed b y Metropolitan F amily Services. W e
will be collecting information from students related to school beha vior and
social emotional dev elopment; information directly from parents about their
satisfaction with the progr am and in volvement with their child's academic
life; information from teachers related to the academic performance and
classroom beha vior of the students enrolled in Communit y School Progr ams,
and academic data from the client's school record.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
With the h ypothesis that the communit y schools model helps a student
develop internal and external assets our primary research question is: what
are the impacts that communit y school progr ams are ha ving on students'
attitude and beha viors. Specifically , what assets dev eloped in the following
areas: support, empowerment, boundaries and expectations, constructiv e
use of time, commitment to learning, and social-emotional competencies.Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?

We will also be collecting information directly from parents about their

We will also collect information from teachers related to the academic
performance and classroom beha vior of the students enrolled in Communit y
School Progr ams. W e may also collect data from the client's school record
(through the Chicago Public School system).
 Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
1. Evaluate the impact that the communit y school progr ams are ha ving on
students' attitudes and beha viors. Specifically , we will measure if the
progr am helps a student dev elop assets in the following areas: support,
empowerment, boundaries and expectations, constructiv e use of time,
commitment to learning, positiv e values, social competencies, and positiv e
identit y. This is important information to collect for sev eral reasons. First, it
is anticipated that the communit y schools progr am model will help a student
develop internal and external assets. Second, it is theoriz ed that there is a
relationship between health y and the dev elopment of assets and school
achiev ement.
 
2. Evaluate the impact that the communit y school progr ams are ha ving on
parental support and in volvement. Specifically , we will be measuring if the
communit y school progr am has an impact on the amount of time that
parents help their kids with school work, or support them in school-related
activities (such parent -teacher conferences or v olunteering for field trips).
This objectiv e is critical since it is commonly believ ed that students who lack
this type of support ha ve difficult y in achieving in school. The communit y
school progr am, being more than just an afterschool progr am, is designed to
work with parents and increase their capacit y to support their child
academically
 
3. Evaluate progr am satisfaction among students and parents.
 
4. Dev elop common benchmarks of success using data from all progr ams.
This is an important objectiv e because until benchmarks indicators are set, it
is difficult for organizations to determine the real effectiv eness of their
progr ams. Benchmarks can also help organizations set more accur ate and
informed expectations of progr am success.
 
5. Use data to mak e mak e recommendations for impro vement to the
existing communit y schools model. It is important that research findings be
constantly used to impro ve progr am models. Through this research, the
findings ma y show that some communit y school activities result in better
outcomes than other . The study team would be able to share this
information with organizations lik e the F ederation for Communit y Schools, so
that other non-profits can adopt the potential best pr actices identified
through this study .
 6. Meet the new research policy requirements established b y CPS . Recently ,
CPS dev eloped a policy mandating that all non-CPS staff wishing to conduct
any type of progr am ev aluation or research gain IRB appro val before doing
so. What mak es this policy v ery challenging, is the CPS themselv es does not
support their own accredited IRB board. As a result, an y non-profits
managing communit y school progr ams who w ant and need to ev aluate their
progr ams must first get IRB appro val for their research through a univ ersity,
hospital, or priv ate IRB board. By accomplishing this objectiv e, we will
ensure that the children enrolled in the listed communit y school progr ams
will ha ve their confidentialit y protected, and will also
allow Metropolitan F amily Services to collect better and more comprehensiv e
information about their progr ams.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
There will be two t ypes of analytical techniques applied to this study . One
being a descriptiv e analysis, this method aims to answer the questions
""what occurred through the y ear"" this allows us to order , manipulate, and
interpret data from the v arious sources and turn it into v aluable insights for
the study . This analysis is essential and it allows us to present our insights in
a meaningful w ay. In addition, an explor atory analysis will be used to
explore the relationships between the data and v ariables. this will enable us
to find connections and respond to the h ypothesis in question."

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The Fund will use this research to in vestigate principal satisfaction across
time and based on a v ariety of factors. The Fund is interested in how
satisfaction changes across y ears and in response to policy and pr actice
changes and also whether it correlates with additional demogr aphic factors
such as principal experience, school char acteristics and district -oper ated
versus charter -oper ated schools. The Fund also hopes to learn more about
additional areas on the principal pipeline including whether or not principal
retention changes o ver time, what the Chicago principal professional dev elop
landscape looks lik e and how principals perceiv e their options. The Fund
hopes to learn more about principal professional dev elopment needs,
budgetary needs and restrictions, and o verall satisfaction with the
development they currently receiv e.

The Field Studies progr am is a collabor ation between the Chicago Public
Schools (CPS) Department of Adv ance Learning and Specialt y Progr ams and
the Field Museum’ s School Learning Experiences team with the o verarching
goal of connecting inquiry learning in classrooms with museum assets and
learning expertise. The progr am w as formerly titled MY PLACE, but has
changed due to shifts from a focus on personaliz ed learning to inquiry
learning.  There are currently six schools engaging in the progr am; T alcott
Fine Arts and Museum Academ y, Louis P asteur Elementary School, Aldridge
Elementary School, Laur a Ward Elementary School, Nash Elementary School,
and Hurley Elementary School. Field Studies (then known as MY PLACE)
began in the spring of 2019 when the Field Museum and each partnering
school collabor ated together to dev elop a progr am plan to integr ate museum
resources and expertise into classroom instruction. The 2023-2024 academic
year sa w the Field Museum fully implementing all facets of the progr am
including student -facing workshops, teacher professional dev elopment, and
science nights at schools.  As a result of the success of the previous y ear, we
are looking to continue the progr am at the identified schools and work with
additional schools. In order to understand the impact of the implementation
of the progr am activities as selected b y the schools, the Field Museum and
CPS Department of Adv ance Learning and Specialt y Progr ams seek to
conduct an ev aluation project that collects data from participating Field
Studies teachers and parents. The ev aluation project will bring to light the
current impact of the progr am and will support the progr am team and
partnering schools in determining shifts for the following school y ear
progr am.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The o verarching research question of this ev aluation project is: T o what
extent does the Field Studies progr am impact teacher pr actice, beha vior, and
attitude? This research question is connected to the Field Studies Theory of
Change (see A ttachment 1) in that b y impacting teacher pr actice and
modeling inquiry , student learning increases. Our o verall hypothesis is that
the Field Studies progr am will lead to increased student learning through
changes in teacher pr actice and the integr ation of museum resources into
learning experiences. 
The ev aluation methodology for this project will be as follows: a summativ e
progr am surv ey designed for each of the partnering schools according to the
goals the participating teachers at each school set for the Field Studies
progr am, and a post -family ev ent surv ey for parents (see A ttachment 2 -
Survey Instruments). The data, consisting of both quantitativ e and
qualitativ e information, will be analyz ed by the progr am team, composed of
Field Museum staff and CPS staff .","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The purpose of this ev aluation project is fundamentally to support the Field
Studies progr am team and partnering schools in order to understand 1)
progr am impact within individual schools as it relates to the contextualiz ed
progr am goals of that school and 2) progr am impact across schools as it
refers to common progr am elements such as the use of specific museum
resources selected b y all three schools. The compiled data will be primarily
utilized within the progr amming team and with partnering schools to support
informed progr am decision making for the next academic y ear. Secondary
use cases will be in gr ant reporting and with potential progr am funders.
Seeing as this is the fifth y ear of progr am implementation, the team is v ery
interested in building on the data collected in the previous y ear, specifically
how the progr am is impacting teaching beha viors and how the progr am
meets the needs of teachers in this new age of education. 
We recogniz e that this project is founded on previous research in both the
fields of museum education and personaliz ed learning (See A ttachment 3 -
Literature R eview), in that there is clear data about the importance of
leveraging in and out of school learning opportunities for students and
common elements to effectiv e personaliz ed learning instruction. 
We hope the Field Studies research project contributes to the larger field of
education in that through this particular research project, we seek to in vite
our school partners into the ev aluation discussion b y measuring impact
according to what the school is interested in researching. By folding each
school’ s unique progr am goals into the ev aluation, we look to pro vide our
partner schools with an opportunit y to participate in the ev aluation process
much lik e they contributed to the progr am design process. Collabor ating
with schools in a participatory manner on progr am ev aluation could yield
interesting insights into how schools use data to perceiv e impact and how
school partners, lik e museums, can be more responsiv e to individual school
contexts.","to Date
The Field Studies progr am is a collabor ation between the Chicago Public
Schools (CPS) Department of Adv ance Learning and Specialt y Progr ams and
the Field Museum’ s School Learning Experiences team with the o verarching
goal of connecting inquiry learning in classrooms with museum assets and
learning expertise. The progr am w as formerly titled MY PLACE, but has
changed due to shifts from a focus on personaliz ed learning to inquiry
learning. There are currently four schools engaging in the progr am; T alcott
Fine Arts and Museum Academ y, Louis P asteur Elementary School, Aldridge
Elementary School, and Hurley Elementary School. Field Studies (then
known as MY PLACE) began in the spring of 2019 when the Field Museum
and three partnering schools collabor ated together to dev elop a progr am
plan to integr ate museum resources and expertise into classroom
instruction. Through this participatory design process, each school dev eloped
a unique progr am plan to be implemented in select classrooms during the
2019-2020 school y ear. The schools and Field Museum modified the
implementation plan going into the 2020-2021 academic y ear, taking lessons
learned from the previous y ear and considering the COVID-19 health crisis
and impact on school structures. F or the 2021-2022 school y ear, the
progr am shifted again to meet the needs of teachers and students as the
COVID-19 health crisis continues to affect the dynamics of schools. As a
result, each school engaged in a highly flexible plan designed to build upon
the progr am outcomes and support teachers in na vigating the school y ear.
The 2022-2023 academic y ear sa w the Field Museum fully implementing all
facets of the progr am including student -facing workshops, teacher
professional dev elopment, and science nights at schools. F or the 2023-2024
school y ear, we are working with the identified partnership schools to
implement inquiry -based workshops for students, teacher professional
development on using museum resources in the classroom, and hosting
Inquiry Nights at the partner schools. W e are also expanding the workshop
curriculum to include topics in science and social science.
As a result of the success of the previous y ears, we are looking to continue
the progr am at the identified schools and work with additional schools. In
order to understand the impact of the implementation of the progr am
activities as selected b y the schools, the Field Museum and CPS Department
of Adv ance Learning and Specialt y Progr ams seek to conduct an ev aluation
project that collects data from participating Field Studies teachers and
parents. The ev aluation project will bring to light the current impact of the
progr am and will support the progr am team and partnering schools in
determining shifts for the following school y ear progr am.Preliminary Results to Date
In the 2022-2023 academic y ear, Talcott Fine Arts and Museum Academ y
had 560 students in 1st -5th gr ade, 8 teachers, and two school
administr ators participate in the progr am. Louis P asteur Elementary School
had 323 students in 3rd and 4th gr ade, and 7 teachers, and two school
administr ators participated in the progr am. Hurley Elementary School had
326 students in 1st -5th gr ade, 6 teachers, and 2 school administr ators
participate in the progr am.
The progr am goals for the 2022-2023 academic y ear included:

The research method will be in the form of a participation surv ey. The surv ey
is comprised of
questions designed to collect both quantifiable and qualitativ e data. These
surveys focus on the student workshop experience as well as teacher
professional dev elopment. By dev eloping surv eys that focus on questions
that cross all four schools’ experiences, the Field Studies progr am team
hopes to collect data that informs progr am impact on multiple lev els both
within and across the partnering schools. This data will be used to guide not
only progr am planning for next academic y ear but also future ev aluation
questions.
The research method will use two data collection forms including: a post -
family ev ent surv ey for parents, and a summativ e progr am surv ey for
teachers. Methods will be conducted via on-line tool Alchemer . By dev eloping
a suite of data collection methods that are composed of both quantifiable
and qualitativ e data, the Field Studies team seeks to gain a holistic
understanding of the progr am’s effectiv eness on both teachers and students.
Utilizing opportunities to capture snapshots of data throughout the progr am
will allow for more in-depth analysis of the specific progr am components and
provide a sense as to how the components create broader impact when
layered together . The o verall data will be used to guide not only progr am
planning for next academic y ear but also support a thesis as to how this
progr am model might be scaled in the future. The data collection will begin
in Quarter 4 of the school y ear (April 2, 2024) and will end just prior to the
end of the school y ear (June 7, 2024). During the course of this time fr ame,
teachers will complete and submit: post -workshop questionnaires, one post -
family ev ent surv ey, and one summativ e progr am surv ey.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
No personally identifiable information (lik e the name of the respondent, email
address) will be shared in an y distribution of the analysis of the ev aluation.
Participants with the appropriate consent will be giv en a four -digit number

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
 
The Field Studies progr am is a collabor ation between the Chicago Public
Schools (CPS) Department of Adv ance Learning and Specialt y Progr ams and
the Field Museum’ s School Learning Experiences team with the o verarching
goal of connecting inquiry learning in classrooms with museum assets and
learning expertise. The progr am w as formerly titled MY PLACE, but has
changed due to shifts from a focus on personaliz ed learning to inquiry
learning.  There are currently six schools engaging in the progr am; T alcott
Fine Arts and Museum Academ y, Louis P asteur Elementary School, Aldridge
Elementary School, Laur a Ward Elementary School, Nash Elementary School,
and Hurley Elementary School. Field Studies (then known as MY PLACE)
began in the spring of 2019 when the Field Museum and each partnering
school collabor ated together to dev elop a progr am plan to integr ate museum
resources and expertise into classroom instruction. The 2023-2024 academic
year sa w the Field Museum fully implementing all facets of the progr am
including student -facing workshops, teacher professional dev elopment, and
science nights at schools.  As a result of the success of the previous y ear, we
are looking to continue the progr am at the identified schools and work with
additional schools. In order to understand the impact of the implementation
of the progr am activities as selected b y the schools, the Field Museum and
CPS Department of Adv ance Learning and Specialt y Progr ams seek to
conduct an ev aluation project that collects data from participating Field
Studies teachers and parents. The ev aluation project will bring to light the
current impact of the progr am and will support the progr am team and
partnering schools in determining shifts for the following school y ear
progr am.Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The o verarching research question of this ev aluation project is: T o what
extent does the Field Studies progr am impact teacher pr actice, beha vior, and
attitude? This research question is connected to the Field Studies Theory of
Change (see A ttachment 1) in that b y impacting teacher pr actice and
modeling inquiry , student learning increases. Our o verall hypothesis is that
the Field Studies progr am will lead to increased student learning through
changes in teacher pr actice and the integr ation of museum resources into
learning experiences. 
The ev aluation methodology for this project will be as follows: a summativ e
progr am surv ey designed for each of the partnering schools according to the
goals the participating teachers at each school set for the Field Studies
progr am, and a post -family ev ent surv ey for parents (see A ttachment 2 -
Survey Instruments). The data, consisting of both quantitativ e and
qualitativ e information, will be analyz ed by the progr am team, composed of
Field Museum staff and CPS staff .Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The purpose of this ev aluation project is fundamentally to support the Field
Studies progr am team and partnering schools in order to understand 1)
progr am impact within individual schools as it relates to the contextualiz ed
progr am goals of that school and 2) progr am impact across schools as it
refers to common progr am elements such as the use of specific museum
resources selected b y all three schools. The compiled data will be primarily
utilized within the progr amming team and with partnering schools to support
informed progr am decision making for the next academic y ear. Secondary
use cases will be in gr ant reporting and with potential progr am funders.
Seeing as this is the fifth y ear of progr am implementation, the team is v ery
interested in building on the data collected in the previous y ear, specifically
how the progr am is impacting teaching beha viors and how the progr am
meets the needs of teachers in this new age of education. 
We recogniz e that this project is founded on previous research in both the
fields of museum education and personaliz ed learning (See A ttachment 3 -
Literature R eview), in that there is clear data about the importance of
leveraging in and out of school learning opportunities for students and
common elements to effectiv e personaliz ed learning instruction. 
We hope the Field Studies research project contributes to the larger field of
education in that through this particular research project, we seek to in vite
our school partners into the ev aluation discussion b y measuring impact
according to what the school is interested in researching. By folding each
school’ s unique progr am goals into the ev aluation, we look to pro vide our
partner schools with an opportunit y to participate in the ev aluation process
much lik e they contributed to the progr am design process. Collabor ating
with schools in a participatory manner on progr am ev aluation could yield
interesting insights into how schools use data to perceiv e impact and how
school partners, lik e museums, can be more responsiv e to individual school
contexts.

What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build
upon the body of extant knowledge?
One of the biggest challenges for Latinx and Black families comes when children
finish high school and parents must decide whether to send their children to
college. F or man y parents from underrepresented groups, this is a major decision,
given the fact that their children fall in the category of
low-income first -gener ation students, and in man y cases the parents do not
understand how to na vigate the higher education system or seek financial
assistance. This is especially true for parents who ha ve a low proficiency in English,
because it is a built -in disadv antage when it comes to guiding their children on the
route to college (Brown et al. , 2003; Santiago , 2009). When ask ed about the
underlying reasons wh y Black and Hispanic people are underrepresented in STEM
fields, those working in STEM often point to factors rooted in educational
opportunities (Collins, 2018; Nealy & Orgill, 2020). Some 52% of those with a
STEM job sa y a major reason for the underrepresentation is that Black and
Hispanic people are less lik ely to ha ve access to qualit y education that prepares
them for these fields. F orty five percent attribute disparities to not being
encour aged to pursue STEM-related subjects at an early age (P ew Research Center ,
2018). Around a third of people working in STEM careers attribute
underrepresentation to not believing in their own abilit y to succeed in these fields
(34%), the lack of Black and Hispanic role models in these fields (32%), and
discrimination in recruitment, hiring and promotions (32%) (P ew Research Center ,
2018).
The SUPERCHARGE project ’s primary focus on STEM education addresses, at a
state lev el, the acute lack of representation of low -income and Students of Color in
STEM progr ams nation wide (NSF , 2019). As shown in T able 2, only 27% of
undergr aduate students in the ISU Department of T echnology
identif y as members of minoritiz ed groups (American Indian/Alaskan Nativ e, Asian,
Black/African American, Ha waiian/P acific Islander , Hispanic, or two or more r ace
selections), and these groups also mak e up only 27% of undergr aduate students in
all ISU STEM-related departments. These same groups
represent 40.8% of the o verall population in the state of Illinois (U .S. Census
Bureau, 2019) and 52.4% of all K -12 students in the state (ISBE School R eport
Card, 2019). SUPERCHARGE is a significant step tow ard encour aging students from
these underserv ed and underrepresented groups to pursue education and career
pathways in STEM fields.

the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
 
In far too man y schools across the United States, new and no vice school
principals feel o verwhelmed, confused, and unsupported in their role
(Grissom & Loeb , 2011). They need more confidence in their decision-
making abilities; they question their abilit y to command the respect of the
members of their school communit y (Leith wood & Jantzi, 2005). Some are
trying to find the connection between and a path through the plethor a of
disjointed professional readings, P owerP oint presentations, flowcharts, one-
pagers, cheat sheets, and other tools that are supposed to help mak e their
role more manageable. Man y new and no vice school leaders are unsure of
where or whom to turn for support. While some new and no vice principals
lack the guidance of an in vested mentor or v eteran school leader to support
their dev elopment and growth, others are reluctant to rely on their assigned
mentors and coaches lest they be perceiv ed as weak, ill-equipped, or worse–
an unqualified imposter . Darling-Hammond et al. (2007) posit professional
learning opportunities, including mentoring structures, for new and no vice
principals, often fit the description of being too ambitious, too abstr act, low
qualit y, disconnected, and/or inconsistent. Therefore, when school leaders
can grow the most in their professional learning and pr actice, they are
stymied b y a lack of targeted and effectiv e support. In a cascading effect,
their stagnation is tr ansferred to their school communit y, which in turn
stymies addressing the opportunit y gaps needed to impro ve student
achiev ement (Fullan, 2001).
The frustr ation and lack of repriev e from the demands of the role lead to the
burnout and tr ansition of school leaders at an astonishing r ate. R esearch
from Superville (2021) asserts that almost fift y percent of principals lea ve
their schools after three y ears. According to Levin et al. (2019), a 2017
national surv ey found that 18 percent of school principals left their positions
from a y ear prior . These statistics become ev en more astonishing in schools
considered hard-to-staff . In one study on the state of T exas, the percentage
of first -year principals is about 40 percent higher in schools with lower
average prior achiev ement compared to those in the top quartile (Br anch et
al., 2013).
The aforementioned challenges and data speak to the t ypical experience of
school leaders across the United States, whether they lead an urban,
suburban, or rur al school. Within Chicago Public Schools (CPS), the third
largest school district in the United States, school leaders experience man y
of the same aforementioned challenges in addition to a unique aspect with
far-reaching implications. Most principals in CPS lead schools that are
governed b y their Local School Council (LSC). In 513 of the district ’s 569
schools, principals ha ve a LSC or some nuanced iter ation of it. A Local
School Council is an elected, autonomous go verning body of a tr aditional
public school within CPS . While often lik ened to the concept of school
boards, sev eral factors mak e LSCs more complex than school boards. Bryk
et al. (2010) assert that one such factor is that LSCs are comprised ofmembers with v arying lev els of expertise within education. The membership
of LSCs consists of the following representativ es: 6 parents, 2 communit y
members, 2 teachers, 1 non-teaching staff member , 1 (in elementary
schools) or 3 (in high schools) students, and the principal. The LSCs also
have the power to select and offer a four -year contr act to , annually
evaluate, and non-renew the principal of their school. Furthermore, LSCs are
responsible for appro ving (or not appro ving) the annual budget and the
Continuous Impro vement W ork Plan (CIWP), which is the school’ s
impro vement or str ategic plan. 
Another significant consider ation is that LSCs were established in 1988 in a
landmark piece of state-lev el legislation focused on decentr alizing the
governance of CPS and empowering local communities to ha ve a greater sa y
in the oper ation and management of their schools (Bryk et al. , 1998). The
state-lev el legislation, subsequently integr ated into the Illinois School Code,
was a mandate for CPS to implement. While the district is required to
implement it, the district lacks the gener al abilit y to establish policies that
can impro ve man y aspects of its implementation, as they would limit the
rights of LSCs as established b y the legislation (Sm ylie & W enzel, 2006).
While the legislation is specific in how it outlines the gener al structures and
procedures for LSCs, there is a lack of specificit y for how the district can
support the effectiv eness of LSCs with oper ational procedures, as well as
control mechanisms for o versight and supervision (Sm ylie & W enzel, 2006).
As a result, when LSC Members do not act in good faith or commit violations
of the Open Meetings Act (OMA) or the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),
there is little if an y recourse. This imbalance of power and recourse between
LSCs and principals mak es the LSC -Principal relationship quite delicate and
often a minefield for school leaders (Hess, 1999). 
Serving in the newly created role of Director of LSC Principal Supports within
CPS, I am k eenly a ware of how the fr agility of the LSC -Principal relationship
is magnified for new and no vice leaders, as they often lack the skills to
navigate the professional and political dangers of the minefield. My role w as
created to ev aluate, impro ve, and refine systems, structures, and tools to
empower LSC Members to fulfill their roles and responsibilities. In addition, I
am responsible for engaging v arious stak eholders to understand better their
successes, challenges, and needs, as well as opportunities to impro ve the
experience and impact of LSC Members. When engaging with school leaders
who are within the first fiv e years of their role, I consistently observ e a lack
of awareness of how to na vigate their relationship with their LSC.
Oftentimes, they focus on policy or procedur al violations committed b y
council members in an attempt to compel the district to disqualif y them from
LSC membership–more often than not, to no a vail.
While it is true that “Since the late 1980s, local control of schools has
become an increasingly common str ategy for impro ving public education, ”
Chicago Public Schools is unique because of the LSC dynamic (R yan et al. ,
1997). In man y other school districts, the local control of schools simply
manifests in the form of shared decision-making and some v ersion of
decentr alization. Because of the previously referenced minefield, the unique
structure and authorit y of LSCs, and the limited requirements for eligibilit y
to be elected to LSCs, successful CPS principals of schools with LSCs musthave a strong understanding of and be equipped with robust skills in
interpersonal communication, influence, adaptabilit y, and na vigating
complex organizational relationships. The uniqueness of the oper ational and
political stance of LSCs within the educational landscape results in extremely
limited resources and support for new and no vice principals na vigating this
aspect of their role. 
Though some principal prepar ation progr ams support aspiring school leaders
with how to independently engage with the v arying stak eholder groups that
are represented on LSCs, there is a v oid of well-dev eloped curricula and
tools specifically targeted for principals to successfully na vigate their
relationships with their LSCs (Darling-Hammond et al. , 2010). Often, well-
intentioned individuals who support new and no vice CPS principals mak e
recommendations to utiliz e resources related to board relations. Such
recommendations are r ather m yopic and indicativ e of a lack of
understanding of the complexities of the CPS principalship . Resources for
executiv e leaders, such as ex ecutiv e directors or CEOs, and their
relationship with their board of directors are often quite v ague and not
specific enough to education or school settings to be helpful for principals
(Orr, 2006). R esources specific to na vigating school boards are most
applicable to superintendents. They usually lack the specifics that principals
need to engage with their LSC, and they are often inclusiv e of information
and/or references that are adjacent v ersus relev ant to principals. F or new
and no vice principals, who often need v ery targeted and concrete resources,
attempting to use resources intended for a superintendent or other
executiv e leaders can be o verwhelming, confusing, and ev en useless
(Jackson and K elley, 2002).","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The primary questions that will driv e my research are as follows: 
What k ey competencies are needed for new and no vice school leaders
to have a thriving relationship with their LSC? 
How is the LSC -principal relationship different for those in Title I or
hard-to-staff schools v ersus school leaders of schools that identif y

What can CPS do to mitigate the issue of principal turno ver as a result

How can local educational leadership dev elopment organizations and
entities support aspiring principals in CPS b y providing the necessary
support for principals to impro ve their skill set to engage with an LSC?","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The relationship between principal retention, leadership dev elopment, and
governance structures lik e Local School Councils (LSCs) within Chicago
Public Schools (CPS) has a long and complex history . The existing liter ature
provides a foundation for understanding the unique challenges and
opportunities faced b y novice principals in large urban districts such as CPS .
This review highlights the historical context of these issues and outlines how
the proposed study will build on existing knowledge to further explore the
effectiv eness of support systems for no vice principals in CPS .
Historical Context of Principal Retention in Hard-to-Staff Schools
Principal retention has long been a critical issue, especially in hard-to-staff
schools, where leadership turno ver has a disproportionate impact on student
outcomes. R esearch b y Branch, Hanushek, and Rivkin (2013) in T exas
revealed how high turno ver rates in low -performing schools lead to
disruptions in school stabilit y and student progress. In a similar v ein, CPS
faces its own retention challenges, with man y principals lea ving their
positions within their first fiv e years, often due to the immense pressures of
the role (Chicago Public Education Fund, 2015). Historically , CPS has
struggled to maintain consistent leadership , particularly in schools serving
high-po verty communities, where the need for strong, stable leadership is
most critical.
The issue of principal retention is not new , but the urgency has increased as
the expectations placed on school leaders ha ve expanded. The proposed
study will explore how specific support systems, particularly those connected
to LSC -principal inter actions, can mitigate these turno ver rates and
contribute to longer -term retention, especially in hard-to-staff schools.
The Role of Local School Councils in Governance and Leadership
Since the establishment of LSCs in CPS in the late 1980s, their role in school
governance has been a topic of consider able debate. LSCs were created as
part of a broader mo vement tow ard decentr alizing school go vernance and
increasing communit y involvement in decision-making (R yan et al. , 1997).
These councils ha ve substantial authorit y, including appro ving school
budgets and ev aluating principals, which can significantly influence a
principal’ s effectiv eness and job satisfaction (Bryk et al. , 2010).
Sanchez (2015) emphasiz ed the dual role of LSCs as both supporters and
challengers of school leadership . On one hand, LSCs ha ve the potential to
act as catalysts for positiv e change; on the other hand, they can also
complicate the principal’ s abilit y to lead effectiv ely if the relationship is not
managed well. This study aims to further in vestigate the LSC -principal
dynamic, particularly how LSCs can pro vide more effectiv e support for
novice principals, helping them na vigate these go vernance structures whilestill maintaining their focus on instructional leadership .
Challenges in Leadership Succession and Principal Development
Leadership succession is a critical factor in maintaining continuit y within
schools, y et man y districts, including CPS , struggle to implement effectiv e
succession planning. Cieminski (2018) argued that leadership succession
planning is essential for maintaining school effectiv eness and ensuring that
novice principals are prepared to lead. Historically , CPS has faced difficulties
in ensuring that leadership tr ansitions are smooth and that incoming
principals ha ve the necessary supports to succeed.
The proposed study will build on Cieminski’ s findings b y evaluating the
current succession pr actices in CPS and identif ying w ays in which LSCs and
other support structures can contribute to more effectiv e transitions for
novice principals. By focusing on the early y ears of a principal’ s tenure, this
research seeks to identif y the k ey supports that help prev ent turno ver and
ensure that new principals are positioned for long-term success.
Professional Development and Mentorship for Novice Principals
Darling-Hammond et al. (2007) and Darling-Hammond et al. (2010)
provided a comprehensiv e examination of the professional dev elopment and
mentorship structures that are intended to support no vice principals. Their
research highlights a significant gap between the ambition of these
progr ams and their pr actical effectiv eness, particularly in urban districts lik e
CPS. Man y professional dev elopment opportunities are disconnected from
the da y-to-da y realities of school leadership , leaving no vice principals
underprepared to manage both instructional and oper ational responsibilities.
This study will examine how these professional dev elopment progr ams align
with the needs of CPS principals, particularly those in their first fiv e years.
The research will also explore how LSCs can pla y a role in enhancing these
support structures, pro viding mentorship and guidance that is more tailored
to the specific challenges faced b y novice principals in CPS .
Burnout and Leadership Challenges
The issue of burnout among school principals is well-documented, with
studies such as Friedman (2002) and Fullan (2001) highlighting how the
overwhelming demands of the role, coupled with insufficient support,
contribute to high lev els of stress and ev entual burnout. This burnout not
only affects the principal’ s well-being but also has a ripple effect throughout
the school, often leading to declines in student performance and teacher
morale.
In CPS , where principals are often task ed with managing complex political
and social en vironments, burnout is a significant concern. The proposed
study will in vestigate how support systems—specifically those in volving LSCs
—can help reduce burnout b y fostering more collabor ative and supportiv e
relationships between school leaders and their go verning bodies.Principal Effectiveness and Transformational Leadership
Grissom and Loeb (2011) and Leith wood and Jantzi (2005) highlighted the
importance of managerial skills and tr ansformational leadership in
determining a principal’ s effectiv eness. T ransformational leadership , which
involves inspiring and motiv ating staff , setting clear goals, and fostering a
collabor ative school culture, has been shown to impro ve student outcomes.
Howev er, the success of tr ansformational leadership often hinges on the
principal’ s abilit y to effectiv ely manage relationships with external
stakeholders, including LSCs.
This research will explore how no vice principals in CPS can dev elop and
sustain tr ansformational leadership pr actices while also managing the
demands of LSCs. By examining the specific supports that enable principals
to balance these dual roles, this study aims to pro vide actionable insights
into how CPS can better support its school leaders.
Principal Turnover and Its Broader Implications
Principal turno ver has far -reaching implications for school stabilit y and
student success. Levin, Br adley, and Scott (2019) and Superville (2021)
both identified principal turno ver as a k ey issue in education toda y, noting
that frequent leadership changes disrupt school progress and negativ ely
impact staff and students. Understanding the root causes of turno ver,
particularly in CPS , is essential for dev eloping str ategies to impro ve
retention.
The proposed study builds on this body of knowledge b y focusing specifically
on the relationship between LSCs and no vice principals as a potential factor
in turno ver. By identif ying the challenges and opportunities inherent in this
relationship , the research aims to propose solutions that could help reduce
turno ver and ensure greater stabilit y in CPS schools.
Evaluating Leadership Development Programs
Finally , Patton’ s work on dev elopmental ev aluation (2011, 2012, 2015)
provides a fr amework for assessing the effectiv eness of leadership
development progr ams. His utilization-focused ev aluation approach
emphasiz es the importance of using both qualitativ e and quantitativ e
methods to measure progr am outcomes and mak e evidence-based
impro vements. This study will incorpor ate Patton’ s evaluation techniques to
assess the current support systems for CPS principals, with a focus on
identif ying areas where these systems can be impro ved to better meet the
needs of no vice principals.
Conclusion
The history of principal retention, leadership dev elopment, and LSCinvolvement in CPS reflects ongoing challenges in supporting no vice
principals. The proposed study seeks to build on this existing body of
knowledge b y investigating the specific supports that contribute to principal
success in CPS , particularly those related to LSC inter actions. By focusing on
the early y ears of a principal’ s tenure, this research aims to identif y
strategies that can enhance retention, reduce burnout, and foster more
effectiv e school leadership in one of the nation’ s largest and most div erse
school districts","and Student/Staff Involvement

supervisors, and LSC members.
Integr ation: The quantitativ e and qualitativ e data will be
integr ated during the analysis phase to dr aw comprehensiv e
conclusions. The qualitativ e findings will be used to explain and
expand on the quantitativ e results, pro viding a more holistic view
of the support systems' impact.
2.
Quantitativ e Methods
Surveys: Surv eys will be administered to no vice principals, LSC
members, and principal supervisors. These surv eys will include
Likert-scale items, multiple-choice questions, and some open-
ended responses.
Sampling: P articipants will be selected using purposiv e sampling,
targeting individuals who are lik ely to pro vide relev ant data based
on their experiences with LSCs and principal support systems.
Data Collection: Surv ey responses will be collected using an online
survey platform, ensuring accessibilit y for participants across CPS .
Measurement Constructs: Surv ey items will focus on constructs
such as:
Perceiv ed effectiv eness of LSC support for principalsSatisfaction with district -provided support systems
(mentorship , professional dev elopment)
Challenges in LSC -principal relationships
Principal retention and job satisfaction metrics
3.
Qualitativ e Methods
Interviews: Structured interviews will be conducted with selected
participants (no vice principals, LSC members, and principal
supervisors) based on their surv ey responses. These interviews
will explore their personal experiences, challenges, and
perceptions of the effectiv eness of the support systems in place.
Analytical Techniques
1.
Quantitativ e Data Analysis
Descriptiv e Statistics: Descriptiv e statistics (e.g. , means,
frequencies, percentages) will be used to summariz e the
responses from the surv ey data. This will pro vide an o verview of
the participants’ perceptions and experiences, such as lev els of
satisfaction with LSC support and perceiv ed challenges in their
roles.
Inferential Statistics: Depending on the sample siz e and the
distribution of data, inferential statistics (e.g. , t-tests, ANOV A,
regression analysis) ma y be emplo yed to examine relationships
between v ariables. F or instance, the relationship between the
effectiv eness of LSC support and principal job satisfaction could be
analyz ed.
Cross- Tabulations: Cross-tabulations will be used to compare
responses across different subgroups (e.g. , Title I vs. non- Title I
schools, gender differences). This will help identif y any patterns or
disparities in experiences across different t ypes of schools or
demogr aphic groups.
Correlation Analysis: P earson’ s or Spearman’ s correlation
coefficients will be calculated to determine the strength and
direction of relationships between k ey variables, such as the lev el
of LSC support and principal retention lik elihood.2.
Qualitativ e Data Analysis
Thematic Analysis: The qualitativ e data from interviews and open-
ended surv ey questions will be analyz ed using thematic analysis.
The researcher will identif y key themes and patterns in the
participants' responses, coding the data to categoriz e it into major
themes (e.g. , ""challenges in LSC -principal relationships,"" ""effectiv e
mentorship str ategies,"" ""communication barriers"").
Steps:
Familiarization: The researcher will read through the
interview tr anscripts and notes to gain an initial
understanding of the data.
Coding: Segments of the data will be coded according to
recurring topics or concepts.
Theme Dev elopment: The codes will be organiz ed into
broader themes that capture the essence of participants’
experiences.
Reviewing Themes: The themes will be refined and
reviewed to ensure they accur ately reflect the data and
answer the research questions.
NVivo or A tlas.ti: Qualitativ e data analysis softw are, such as NViv o
or Atlas.ti, will be used to organiz e and code the qualitativ e data
systematically , facilitating the identification of themes across
multiple data sources.
Narrative Analysis: F or individual case studies of no vice principals
or LSC members, narr ative analysis will be applied to explore their
stories and how they describe their experiences with LSCs and
support systems. This technique will help capture the depth and
complexit y of their liv ed experiences.
3.
Triangulation
Data T riangulation: The study will emplo y triangulation b y cross-
referencing the findings from surv eys, interviews, and an analysis
of public data. This process will ensure that the conclusions dr awnare robust and supported b y multiple data sources.
Convergence and Div ergence Analysis: P oints of con vergence
(agreement across data sources) and div ergence (discrepancies
between sources) will be identified to pro vide a nuanced
understanding of the research problem. F or example, a principal’ s
perception of LSC support might differ from what is perceiv ed by
LSC Members and principal supervisors.
4.
Interpretativ e Analysis
Interpretation of Findings: The findings will be interpreted in the
context of the existing liter ature on principal support systems,
governance, and retention. Special attention will be paid to
identif ying how the unique structure of LSCs within CPS influences
the effectiv eness of no vice principals. The results will be used to
offer recommendations for impro ving support systems and policies
within CPS .
Linking to Theory: The themes and quantitativ e results will be
analyz ed in relation to tr ansformational leadership theory and
principal succession theories to pro vide a theoretical fr amework for
the findings. F or example, how tr ansformational leadership
practices inter act with LSC support will be explored in detail.
Ethical Considerations
Informed Consent: All participants will be pro vided with informed
consent forms explaining the study’ s purpose, their role, and the
measures tak en to protect their confidentialit y. Participants will be
reminded that their participation is v oluntary and that they can
withdr aw from the study at an y time.
Confidentialit y: Data will be stored securely , and pseudon yms will be
used in all reports and publications to protect participant identities.
Bias Mitigation: The researcher will be vigilant about reflexivit y and
bias, ensuring that personal assumptions do not interfere with data
interpretation. R egular debriefing sessions with a peer or advisor will
help to maintain objectivit y."

Before enrollment and after consent has been collected, students will
complete a short baseline surv ey during study enrollment, designed to tak e
about a half hour . This surv ey will be completed in person, with the Bridges
ER before r andom assignment, along with participant contact information.
Enrollment activities ma y occur at school, but will not interfere with
instructional time.
Mathematica will contact participants to complete two 50-minute follow -up
surveys, 9 and 21 months after enrollment. T wo follow -up participant
surveys will be administered at 9 and 21 months after r andom assignment,
gener ally when study participants ha ve already gr aduated from CPS . These
surveys will be self -administered online or administered b y telephone b y
NextGen Project staff . Follow-up surv eys will collect data on service receipt,
emplo yment, earnings, economic independence, well-being, ph ysical and
mental health status, substance use, criminal justice system in volvement,
and (treatment group only) perceptions of the usefulness of Bridges.
We will also conduct up to 20 in-depth interviews with y outh in the
treatment group across all participating Bridges cities; we expect up to 5 of
these to be with CPS students. The interviews will collect information on
participants’ background and goals, experiences and challenges finding and
retaining emplo yment, and experiences with Bridges. These interviews will
occur in person or virtually with a member of the NextGen Project staff .","Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The Bridges from School to W ork (Bridges) progr am pro vides job readiness
instruction, placement, and post -placement support for special education
students as they tr ansition out of high school. An ev aluation of Bridges is
being conducted b y Mathematica, with funding from the Office of Planning,
Research, and Ev aluation (OPRE) within the Administr ation for Children and
Families at the U .S. Department of Health and Human Services in
partnership with the Social Securit y Administr ation (S SA). It will examine
Bridges’ effectiv eness in helping students find and k eep jobs and a void
receipt of public assistance.
Bridges currently oper ates in about 90 high schools in Chicago Public
Schools (CPS), and the study will allow Bridges to expand services to at
around 240 students in about 30 schools o ver three school y ears (2021-
2022 and 2022-2023, and 2023-2024). All study activities can tak e place
remotely , if needed. After the initial referr al process to identif y suitable
participants, all study activities will tak e place outside of school, and can
occur in-person or virtually . Students will complete a short baseline surv ey
during study enrollment and 50-minute follow -up surv eys 9 and 21 months
after enrollment. Up to 5 students will participate in an in-depth interview .
Students who participate in these study activities will be compensated.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The Next Gener ation of Enhanced Emplo yment Str ategies (NextGen) Project,
sponsored b y OPRE, seeks to identif y and rigorously ev aluate the
effectiv eness of inno vative progr ams designed to promote emplo yment and
economic securit y among low -income individuals with complex challenges to
work. The project is working closely with the S SA to incorpor ate a focus on
emplo yment -related early interv entions for individuals with current or
foreseeable disabilities who ha ve limited work history and are at risk of
applying for Supplemental Securit y Income (S SI).
The NextGen Project identified the Bridges progr am because of its work
helping high school students in special education secure paid, competitiv e
emplo yment in integr ated settings as they tr ansition out of school. The
progr am w as dev eloped with support from the Marriott F oundation for P eople
with Disabilities. Ov er its 30- year history , the progr am has placed more than
20,000 special education students into paid, competitiv e jobs with more
than 6,000 emplo yers across the country . The progr am currently oper ates in
90 schools in CPS and Bridges intends to continue service pro vision in those
schools unchanged, and separ ate from this research proposal. Bridges staff:
- work with participants to identif y their interests, skills, and accommodation
needs through interviews with participants and information gathering from
their teachers and family members. 
 - support students in preparing résumés and tr ain students on soft skills
including instruction on topics such as shaking hands, making ey e contact,
having con versations with supervisors, and grooming and presentation for
interviews and emplo yment;
- guide job dev elopment and placement, including working with y outh to
search for jobs, completing job applications, preparing for and attending job
interviews, and completing the hiring process;
- provide extensiv e follow -along support after job placement for 12 months
—staff are continuously a vailable to , and regularly check in with, students
and their direct supervisors to identif y accommodations and assess work
performance; and
- work with local emplo yers to identif y their hiring needs so they can match
them with qualified applicants from the Bridges participant pool.
The ev aluation of Bridges will consist of two study components. The first, an
impact study , will address the effect of Bridges on y outh’s outcomes. The
second, a descriptiv e study will describe how the progr am is designed and
implemented. The questions that fall under each category are described
below .
1. What is the effect of Bridges on y outh’s outcomes?
- Did Bridges affect the amount and t ypes of emplo yment services receiv ed?
- Did Bridges impro ve emplo yment outcomes (emplo yment, earnings, job
retention and - adv ancement, and job qualit y) and economic independence
(income, public assistance receipt)?
- Did Bridges impro ve education outcomes such as completion of high
school?
- Did Bridges reduce substance abuse, impro ve physical and mental health,and reduce criminal justice in volvement?
- Was Bridges more effectiv e for some groups than others?
- How did the cost of Bridges compare to the benefit of the impacts it
gener ated? What were the net benefits for students and societ y as a whole?
2. How is Bridges designed and implemented?
- What were the char acteristics of students eligible for Bridges?
- What were the students’ participation and outcome patterns?
- What contextual, organizational, and other factors impeded or facilitated
implementation?
- What were the implementation challenges faced, solutions, and lessons
learned?
- What role did emplo yers pla y in the progr am?
- How did local labor mark et conditions affect the progr am design,
implementation, and emplo yers’ and students’ in volvement?
- Which progr am services or implementation features appear to be related to
progr am impacts?
The h ypothesis is that Bridges will increase the total amount of support
provided to students for finding and retaining paid competitiv e emplo yment
relativ e to what students would experience without the progr am. This
support will in turn increase the lik elihood of the student finding a job ,
increase their earnings, and reduce their receipt of public assistance. Bridges
may also impro ve education outcomes, impro ve physical and mental health
outcomes, reduce substance abuse, and reduce criminal justice in volvement.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Youth with disabilities ha ve emplo yment r ates that are substantially lower
than those of their peers without disabilities (W agner et al. 2005; Newman
et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2018). F or example, among y outh ages 16–19,
emplo yment r ates are 14 percentage points lower for y outh with disabilities
(Childtrends.org 2019). Man y of these y outh are at high risk of facing a
future of po verty and dependence on public assistance (Da vies et al. 2009;
Rupp et al 2015). Howev er, research has shown that y outh with disabilities
can find and k eep jobs if they ha ve the opportunit y and the necessary
supports (Martinez 2013). R esearchers ha ve found that the opportunit y to
work during the secondary school y ears increases the lik elihood of
emplo yment after the y outh lea ve school (T est et al. 2009; Carter et al.
2012).
The Bridges progr am w as identified for ev aluation as part of the NextGen
Project because of its documented experience in serving y outh with
disabilities, and because of its focus on meeting the needs of emplo yers.
Prior nonexperimental ev aluations of Bridges suggest that the progr am
effectiv ely supports y outh tr ansitioning to adulthood. Bridges’ data o ver the
last two decades show that enrollees ha ve emplo yment r ates that are higher
than other y outh with disabilities (F abian et al. 1998; Luecking & F abian
2000; F abian 2007; Gold et al. 2013). A recent nonexperimental study
revealed that Bridges participation is associated with higher earnings and
reduced reliance on feder al disabilit y benefits for participants through at
least age 30 (Hemmeter et al. 2015).
Despite the promising evidence about Bridges’ participants outcomes,
findings from nonexperimental ev aluations ma y be biased because of
underlying differences between the progr am participants and the comparison
group . The NextGen Project ’s evaluation will be the first to use an
experimental design to ev aluate the impacts of Bridges. Under an
experimental design, the groups offered Bridges and the control group will
be similar .","to Date
Study enrollment began in A ugust 2021. From that time through June 2023,
we ha ve enrolled 222 CPS students into the study from 25 schools (115 in
the group eligible to receiv e Bridges services, 107 in the comparison group).
We will continue study enrollment through the 2023-2024 school y ear, as
appro ved in the Ma y 2022 modification.
Bridges continues to work with CPS staff to identif y schools to participate in
the study . The point of contact in the district is now T ora Evans, the ODLS S
Director of Service Deliv ery. She became the point of contact after Jessica
Sipovic’s departure. In consultation with Ms. Ev ans and Carolina P olicarpo , a
Transition Specialist at CPS , Bridges receiv ed principal support from an
additional 10 schools during the 2022-2023 school y ear. Including these 10
new schools, the current total number of CPS schools with principal support
to participate in the study is 28. W e list the schools added to and the study
since we last reported below .
Follow-up surv ey data collection continues, with study participants being
contacted to be interviewed 9 and 21 months after study enrollment. W e
continue to follow protocols for data collection outlined in earlier
submissions. W e have attached to our application the most recent annual
IRB appro val letter for our study , covering the January 2023- January 2024
period; we expect that will receiv e continuing appro val from our study IRB
at that time.
Preliminary Results to Date
We do not ha ve any results to report y et. W e are currently documenting the
Bridges model for an implementation study that we expect to be ready in
2024; we will share that report with the district when it is a vailable. With the
extended study enrollment timeline, we are anticipating the first impact
report to be ready in 2027, as documented in our modification in 2022.

those schools without consultation with CPS ODLS S staff and principal
support.
Across all participating districts, enrollment has continued to be a challenge.
We work ed with Bridges this y ear to reduce our enrollment goal to 1,000

Interviews
Secondary Data R equestPlease outline your protocol for individual interview activities,
describing when, where, duration, frequency, and with whom.
Before enrollment and after consent has been collected, students will
complete a short baseline surv ey during study enrollment, designed to tak e
about a half hour . This surv ey will be completed in person, with the Bridges
ER before r andom assignment, along with participant contact information.
Enrollment activities ma y occur at school, but will not interfere with
instructional time.
Mathematica will contact participants to complete two 50-minute follow -up
surveys, 9 and 21 months after enrollment. T wo follow -up participant
surveys will be administered at 9 and 21 months after r andom assignment,
gener ally when study participants ha ve already gr aduated from CPS . These
surveys will be self -administered online or administered b y telephone b y
NextGen Project staff . Follow-up surv eys will collect data on service receipt,
emplo yment, earnings, economic independence, well-being, ph ysical and
mental health status, substance use, criminal justice system in volvement,
and (treatment group only) perceptions of the usefulness of Bridges.
We will also conduct up to 20 in-depth interviews with y outh in the
treatment group across all participating Bridges cities; we expect up to 5 of
these to be with CPS students. The interviews will collect information on
participants’ background and goals, experiences and challenges finding and
retaining emplo yment, and experiences with Bridges. These interviews will
occur in person or virtually with a member of the NextGen Project staff .
Does this involve video, audio, or photograph recording?
Yes
Please describe the protocol for audio/video recording
We will not record the baseline interview . Follow-up interviews and in-depth
interviews ma y be audio recorded, as described in the consent form. A udio
recordings of the surv eys will be used for qualit y control purposes and will be
destro yed after 6 months. A udio recordings for the additional interview will
be used for research purposes and will be destro yed at the end of the study .
If study participants and/or their parents do not consent to audio recordings,
we will not record them; participants will be free to continue to participate in
the interview ev en if they do not consent to recording.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
Any data stored electronically , including audio recordings of discussions with
progr am administr ators, supervisors, and staff , key partner staff , and
participants, will be secured in accordance with the most current National
Institute of Standards and T echnology requirements and other applicable
Federal and departmental regulations. The project team will minimiz e, to the
extent possible, the inclusion of PII and other sensitiv e information on paper
records, and will protect an y paper records, field notes, or other documents
that contain PII or other sensitiv e information, ensuring secure stor age and
limits on access.
All data collection activities and materials ha ve been appro ved by an
independent IRB and will be appro ved by the Office of Management andBudget before the study begins. K ey research staff ha ve completed CITI
Progr am’s human subjects tr aining.
As specified in its contr act with ACF , Mathematica will comply with all F ederal

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The Bridges from School to W ork (Bridges) progr am pro vides job readiness
instruction, placement, and post -placement support for special education
students as they tr ansition out of high school. An ev aluation of Bridges is
being conducted b y Mathematica, with funding from the Office of Planning,
Research, and Ev aluation (OPRE) within the Administr ation for Children and
Families at the U .S. Department of Health and Human Services in
partnership with the Social Securit y Administr ation (S SA). It will examine
Bridges’ effectiv eness in helping students find and k eep jobs and a void
receipt of public assistance.
Bridges currently oper ates in about 90 high schools in Chicago Public
Schools (CPS), and the study will allow Bridges to expand services to at
around 240 students in about 30 schools o ver three school y ears (2021-
2022 and 2022-2023, and 2023-2024). All study activities can tak e place
remotely , if needed. After the initial referr al process to identif y suitable
participants, all study activities will tak e place outside of school, and can
occur in-person or virtually . Students will complete a short baseline surv ey
during study enrollment and 50-minute follow -up surv eys 9 and 21 months
after enrollment. Up to 5 students will participate in an in-depth interview .
Students who participate in these study activities will be compensated. 
 Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The Next Gener ation of Enhanced Emplo yment Str ategies (NextGen) Project,
sponsored b y OPRE, seeks to identif y and rigorously ev aluate the
effectiv eness of inno vative progr ams designed to promote emplo yment and
economic securit y among low -income individuals with complex challenges to
work. The project is working closely with the S SA to incorpor ate a focus on
emplo yment -related early interv entions for individuals with current or
foreseeable disabilities who ha ve limited work history and are at risk of
applying for Supplemental Securit y Income (S SI).
The NextGen Project identified the Bridges progr am because of its work
helping high school students in special education secure paid, competitiv e
emplo yment in integr ated settings as they tr ansition out of school. The
progr am w as dev eloped with support from the Marriott F oundation for P eople
with Disabilities. Ov er its 30- year history , the progr am has placed more than
20,000 special education students into paid, competitiv e jobs with more
than 6,000 emplo yers across the country . The progr am currently oper ates in
90 schools in CPS and Bridges intends to continue service pro vision in those
schools unchanged, and separ ate from this research proposal. Bridges staff:
- work with participants to identif y their interests, skills, and accommodation
needs through interviews with participants and information gathering from
their teachers and family members. 
 - support students in preparing résumés and tr ain students on soft skills
including instruction on topics such as shaking hands, making ey e contact,
having con versations with supervisors, and grooming and presentation for
interviews and emplo yment;
- guide job dev elopment and placement, including working with y outh to
search for jobs, completing job applications, preparing for and attending job
interviews, and completing the hiring process;
- provide extensiv e follow -along support after job placement for 12 months
—staff are continuously a vailable to , and regularly check in with, students
and their direct supervisors to identif y accommodations and assess work
performance; and
- work with local emplo yers to identif y their hiring needs so they can match
them with qualified applicants from the Bridges participant pool.
The ev aluation of Bridges will consist of two study components. The first, an
impact study , will address the effect of Bridges on y outh’s outcomes. The
second, a descriptiv e study will describe how the progr am is designed and
implemented. The questions that fall under each category are described
below .
1. What is the effect of Bridges on y outh’s outcomes?
- Did Bridges affect the amount and t ypes of emplo yment services receiv ed?
- Did Bridges impro ve emplo yment outcomes (emplo yment, earnings, job
retention and - adv ancement, and job qualit y) and economic independence
(income, public assistance receipt)?
- Did Bridges impro ve education outcomes such as completion of high
school?
- Did Bridges reduce substance abuse, impro ve physical and mental health,and reduce criminal justice in volvement?
- Was Bridges more effectiv e for some groups than others?
- How did the cost of Bridges compare to the benefit of the impacts it
gener ated? What were the net benefits for students and societ y as a whole?
2. How is Bridges designed and implemented?
- What were the char acteristics of students eligible for Bridges?
- What were the students’ participation and outcome patterns?
- What contextual, organizational, and other factors impeded or facilitated
implementation?
- What were the implementation challenges faced, solutions, and lessons
learned?
- What role did emplo yers pla y in the progr am?
- How did local labor mark et conditions affect the progr am design,
implementation, and emplo yers’ and students’ in volvement?
- Which progr am services or implementation features appear to be related to
progr am impacts?
The h ypothesis is that Bridges will increase the total amount of support
provided to students for finding and retaining paid competitiv e emplo yment
relativ e to what students would experience without the progr am. This
support will in turn increase the lik elihood of the student finding a job ,
increase their earnings, and reduce their receipt of public assistance. Bridges
may also impro ve education outcomes, impro ve physical and mental health
outcomes, reduce substance abuse, and reduce criminal justice in volvement.
 Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Youth with disabilities ha ve emplo yment r ates that are substantially lower
than those of their peers without disabilities (W agner et al. 2005; Newman
et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2018). F or example, among y outh ages 16–19,
emplo yment r ates are 14 percentage points lower for y outh with disabilities
(Childtrends.org 2019). Man y of these y outh are at high risk of facing a
future of po verty and dependence on public assistance (Da vies et al. 2009;
Rupp et al 2015). Howev er, research has shown that y outh with disabilities
can find and k eep jobs if they ha ve the opportunit y and the necessary
supports (Martinez 2013). R esearchers ha ve found that the opportunit y to
work during the secondary school y ears increases the lik elihood of
emplo yment after the y outh lea ve school (T est et al. 2009; Carter et al.
2012).
The Bridges progr am w as identified for ev aluation as part of the NextGen
Project because of its documented experience in serving y outh with
disabilities, and because of its focus on meeting the needs of emplo yers.
Prior nonexperimental ev aluations of Bridges suggest that the progr am
effectiv ely supports y outh tr ansitioning to adulthood. Bridges’ data o ver the
last two decades show that enrollees ha ve emplo yment r ates that are higher
than other y outh with disabilities (F abian et al. 1998; Luecking & F abian
2000; F abian 2007; Gold et al. 2013). A recent nonexperimental study
revealed that Bridges participation is associated with higher earnings and
reduced reliance on feder al disabilit y benefits for participants through at
least age 30 (Hemmeter et al. 2015).
Despite the promising evidence about Bridges’ participants outcomes,
findings from nonexperimental ev aluations ma y be biased because of
underlying differences between the progr am participants and the comparison
group . The NextGen Project ’s evaluation will be the first to use an
experimental design to ev aluate the impacts of Bridges. Under an
experimental design, the groups offered Bridges and the control group will
be similar .   
 Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
Upon appro val from the CPS R esearch R eview Board, Bridges staff will
discuss the study with selected school administr ators. T o begin to enroll
students at the start of the 2021-2022 school y ear, we aim to ha ve these
conversations starting in spring 2021. Schools ha ve been identified in
consultation with Jessica Sipo vic, Transition Manager in CPS’ s Office of
Diverse Learner Supports and Services. Bridges will present the progr am
and study design to each school principal, and ask whether they would lik e
their school to participate. After securing principal appro val, Bridges will
meet with special education teachers and other school staff who work with
students who ha ve IEPs and/or 504 plans —in-person or virtually —to discuss
the Bridges progr am and the study .
All study participants will be fully informed about the study before they are
enrolled. They will be told about: (1) the data collection and period of
research; (2) the option not to respond to an y surv ey or individual question
in a surv ey; and (3) that they can lea ve the study at an y time without an y
effect on the receipt of Bridges services for those in the group assigned to
receiv e them. In addition to describing the study , Bridges staff will read the
consent/assent form to students interested in participating.
We have IRB appro val for the following consent process:
• Study participants under age 18 at the time of study enrollment will need
written parent or guardian consent to enroll in the study . The student will
also be fully informed about the study and need to assent to the study in
writing, consistent with CPS’ protocols.
• Study participants age 18 or older at the time of study enrollment will
need to pro vide written consent to enroll in the study , again consistent with
CPS’ protocols.
All students and parent/guardians (of students under age 18) will be
provided with a cop y of the consent form for their records. No individual
information will be collected on an y student who does not consent to
participate in the study .
For students who pro vide the necessary consent/assent, Bridges staff will
ask for contact information and administer a short baseline surv ey about
their char acteristics. Staff will then enter the information into a study -
specific database that will r andomly assign students to either the treatment
or control group . Students without the necessary consents will not be able to
participate in Bridges or the study . Students assigned to the control group
will be reminded that they can continue to receiv e all other services for
which they are eligible, but cannot receiv e Bridges services for two y ears.
All study data collection activities can occur virtually if needed, and will
occur outside of school hours. All students who consent to participate in the
study will be ask ed to complete a short baseline surv ey (Appendix B .1)
about their demogr aphics, emplo yment history , challenges to maintainingemplo yment, and contact information. The surv ey will be administered b y
Bridges staff either in-person or virtually (depending on COVID-related
requirements) or self -administered b y study participants.
Outcome data will be collected from two sources: administr ative records and
participant surv eys. 
- Participant surv eys. T wo follow -up participant surv eys will be administered
at 9 and 21 months after r andom assignment, gener ally when study
participants ha ve already gr aduated from CPS . These surv eys will be self -
administered online or administered b y telephone b y NextGen Project staff
(Appendices B .2 and B .3). F ollow-up surv eys will collect data on service
receipt, emplo yment, earnings, economic independence, well-being, ph ysical
and mental health status, substance use, criminal justice system
involvement, and (treatment group only) perceptions of the usefulness of
Bridges.
- Administr ative records. Administr ative records include emplo yment data
from the National Directory of New Hires collected b y the Office of Child
Support Enforcement (originally collected from Unemplo yment Insur ance
agencies) and data from S SA on receipt of disabilit y benefits and earnings.
To obtain these data after consent from participants and their parents, we
will send study participants’ identif ying information (name, Social Securit y
number , date of birth, and sex) to the agencies and they will extr act the
requisite data for study participants from their systems.
A descriptiv e study will address research questions on progr am design and
implementation. Data collection for this study component includes interviews
with Bridges staff and emplo yers (not described here). W e will also conduct
up to 20 in-depth interviews with y outh in the treatment group across all
participating Bridges cities; we expect up to 5 of these to be with CPS
students. The interviews will collect information on participants’ background
and goals, experiences and challenges finding and retaining emplo yment,
and experiences with Bridges (Appendix B .4). These interviews will occur in
person or virtually with a member of the NextGen Project staff .
In dev eloping the surv ey instruments and interview guides, we used
industry best pr actices including using v alidated items from previous surv eys
administered to similar populations to the extent possible. W e pretested the
baseline and follow -up surv eys with low -income populations. W e timed the
interviews, used cognitiv e interviewing, and conducted respondent and
interviewer debriefings to assess respondents’ understanding of the surv ey
questions and identif y impro vements to their wording and flow .
Additionally , Bridges staff will collect progr am administr ation data about the
treatment group members’ participation in the progr am to describe the
service receipt of treatment group members, including t ype of service,
duration, and mode. Bridges will also collect data on the student ’s disabling
condition, as recorded on their IEP/504 plan, as a part of administering the
progr am. Bridges progr am staff will collect this information in an existing
system and share the data with Mathematica via a secure file tr ansfer
protocol.Bridges will also send to Mathematica information recorded in its
management information system on the students’ work goals and
emplo yment outcomes, as well as services that treatment group members
receiv e from Bridges. Students and their parents (if appropriate) will be told
about this data collection during the consent process.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
We will use an experimental research design to address the research
questions about the effectiv eness of Bridges. Students will be fully informed
of implications of participating in the study and will only be enrolled in the
study if they ha ve consented to participate in the study and (if they are
under age 18) obtained parental consent.
A study -specific computer system will r andomly assign students to a
treatment or control group; each student will ha ve a 50 percent chance of
being assigned to the treatment group . Students assigned to the treatment
group will be offered Bridges services and students assigned to the control
group will not. Bridges will pro vide students in the control group a list of
other service pro viders in the school, school district, or communit y that ma y
be able to help them achiev e their emplo yment goals. All study participants,
including those in the control group , continue to receiv e all other services
for which they are eligible. Control group members, howev er, will not be
eligible to participate in Bridges for two y ears. Without the presence of this
study , Bridges would not ha ve funding to expand its services to these
proposed schools; therefore, none of the students at those schools would
have access to Bridges during this timefr ame without this study .
The impact of Bridges will be determined b y comparing the outcomes of
students in the treatment group to the outcomes of students in the control
group . This will include unadjusted and regression- adjusted means for
outcomes. Differences in means or proportions of follow -up outcomes
between the treatment and control groups will pro vide unbiased estimates
of the impacts of Bridges. Estimates that are more precise will be obtained
using regression models to control for r andom differences in the baseline
characteristics of treatment and control group members. In their simplest
forms, these models can be expressed b y the following equation: Yi = α
+βXi + δTi + εi, where Yi is an outcome (such as earnings) for person i; α is
a constant; Xi is a (column) v ector of baseline char acteristics (such as sex,
age, r ace/ethnicit y); β is a v ector of coefficient par ameters for the extent to
which baseline char acteristics are predictiv e of the outcome; Ti is an
indicator for whether person i receiv ed treatment; δ represents the impact
of the progr am; and εi is an error term.
We will conduct a subgroup analysis to examine the impacts b y student
characteristic. Subgroup effects will be estimated using the following
equation: Yi = α + βXi + δ1Ti + δ2Gi + δ3TiGi + εi, where Gi is an indicator
for whether person i is part of a subgroup; δ2 represents the relationship
between subgroup status and the outcome; and δ3 represents the
additional effect of Bridges for those in the subgroup ."

LEAP Inno vations’ LEAP Learning Initiativ e Customiz ed Pilot Network
Progr am connects inno vation and education to offer an alternativ e to the
one-siz e-fits- all approaches adopted across man y schools. The LEAP
Learning Initiativ e Customiz ed Pilot Network Progr am pro vides coaching and
professional dev elopment support to school team teachers to identif y a
problem of pr actice and an impro vement goal, and to implement and scale
personaliz ed learning that is aligned to LEAP Inno vations’ LEAP Learning
Framework that outlines necessary guidelines that together define
personaliz ed learning. The progr am also pairs school team teachers with
promising EdT ech products to pilot in their classroom to help teachers
implement and scale personaliz ed learning and EdT ech thoughtfully and with
fidelit y.
LEAP partnered with schools in the Chicago Public Schools district to pilot
their progr am. This partnership w as funded b y the Learning Acceler ator
(TLA) as part of TLA ’s Intermediary Network Initiativ e. Through the
initiativ e, TLA aims to adv ance the scale-up of virtually supported, evidence-
based approaches that acceler ate learning in K –12 core instruction.
Mathematica has partnered with TLA and 10 networks of schools across the
country , including LEAP Inno vations’ network of CPS schools piloting its LEAP
Learning Initiativ e Customiz ed Pilot Network Progr am, to conduct an
implementation and impact study of each of the 10 network inno vations (or
interv entions) and produce reports and disseminating actionable evidence.
The goal of this study is to understand how the LEAP progr am w as
implemented, the student outcomes produced, and the set of conditions that
support effectiv e implementation of the progr am. The progr am will be
implemented in 9 schools in the Chicago Public School district (including 2
charter schools – Acero Charter Schools - Esmer alda Santiago and CICS
West Belden) to an estimated 30-50 teachers and 1,500 students across
grades 2-8.  
The study will use a descriptiv e approach to examine how the progr am w as
implemented and enabling conditions for successful implementation. This
approach will use data from a surv ey administered to the teachers
participating in the progr am. The surv ey will be conducted near the end of
the 2024-2025 school y ear when the progr am concludes. The study will also
use a quasi-experimental design approach to compare student outcomes
(that is, performance on a benchmark assessment and attendance) between
students participating in the progr am to a matched group of similar students
not participating in the progr am.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
 
The purpose of this study is to build the evidence base for the effectiv eness
and scaling of the LEAP Learning Initiativ e Customiz ed Pilot Network
Progr am in a post -COVID learning en vironment. The research questions
asked in this study are the following:
Did the inno vation (or interv ention) reach the planned number of
students (classrooms and schools)?
Were the k ey components implemented as intended?
What are the conditions in classrooms, schools, and districts that
promote successful scaling? What are the conditions in the sites that
were unsuccessful in scaling?
Did the inno vation ha ve positiv e effects on student learning as it w as
implemented/scaled? 
How do the effects differ for different groups of students? 
Did the inno vation show potential for long-lasting change in how
teachers teach and/or how students learn?
Do networks and schools need continued funding to sustain the
conditions that led to effectiv e implementation?","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
The LEAP Learning Initiativ e Customiz ed Pilot Network Progr am is rooted in
the LEAP Learning Fr amework.  The LEAP Learning Fr amework (LLF) defines
their model for personaliz ed learning: learning is focused on, led with and
demonstr ated b y the learner , and is connected to career -relev ant, real- world
skills and opportunities. The LLF is rooted in an extensiv e body of K -12
education research and w as dev eloped with input from learning scientists,
experts, researchers and educators. In building and revising the LLF , LEAP
follows the four -phase “Pr axis” Design Methodology: 1) research review; 2)
real-world audit; 3) div erse critiques and integr ated discourses; 4) open
peer review . Most recently , independent researchers from Harv ard and
Arizona State led an external review process in 2019 that affirmed the rigor
of the model. 
LEAP Inno vations also has a base of evidence supporting the efficacy of the
Pilot Network approach. Through 2020, LEAP’ s efficacy research construct
consisted of a comparison of growth in academic achiev ement (measured in
NWEA MAP Growth Assessment RIT points) between the LEAP treatment
group and a propensit y score matched control group with the comparison
being made b y means of multilev el regression models. Students are
matched on a number of k ey indicators such as demogr aphics, gr ade-lev el,
and prior test score, and the regression models include these v ariables as
controls as well. In 2018, after ev aluating four Pilot Network cohorts, we
found that an a verage student using a reading product in the Pilot Network
would gain 13 additional percentile points abo ve an a verage comparison
student starting with the same score. 
The proposed study builds on the prior evidence b y assessing the
effectiv eness of the progr am when scaled to new schools and when
implementing a wider r ange of pilot technology tools in a post -COVID
environment.","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
 
The study team will collect and analyz e the following data to address the
study’ s research questions. These data will serv e to better understand
implementation of LEAP’ s progr am and the impact of the progr am on student
outcomes. 
Teacher surv ey. Teachers at CPS schools that participate in the LEAP
progr am in the 2024-2025 school y ear will complete a 15-minute online
survey to pro vide information on teachers’ views of the usefulness and
usabilit y of the inno vation; the support for implementation they receiv e; and
the school conditions in which the inno vation is being introduced. It will also
collect basic data on teachers’ demogr aphics such as y ears of experience
and gr ades/subjects taught. W e will obtain consent from teachers taking the
Teacher Surv ey at the start of the surv ey. Individuals who participate in the
survey via web will read the consent form online and click a button to record
their consent. The study will include these data in the study only for
teachers who pro vide consent electronically . The study will inform
participants that their participation is v oluntary , and they can choose not to
participate, decline to answer an y question, or stop their participation at an y
time. P articipants will also be giv en the contact information for the research
team if they ha ve any questions, as well as the Institutional R eview Board. 
Student administr ative data. W e will collect administr ative data in the 2023-
2024 and 2024-2025 school y ears for all 2nd through and 8th-gr ade
students to estimate the impact of the LEAP progr am on student outcomes.
For these students, the study will request student demogr aphic data
(including gender , age, r ace/ethnicit y, free/reduced price lunch status,
English Language Learner status, and Special Education status), student test
scores on benchmark assessments (i-R eady and Star 360), and data on
students’ attendance in the 2024-2025 school y ear. For these students, the
study also requests their scaled scores and percentile r ankings for the i-
Ready and Star 360 math and reading assessments for the spring
administr ation (end of y ear) in the 2023-2024 school y ear. We intend to
enter into a Data Sharing agreement with the Chicago Board of Education to
receiv e the requested secondary data.
The administr ative data we are requesting from the district is allowed under
FERPA which permits the disclosure of protected student information without
the prior consent of students in certain circumstances (20 U .S.C. 1232g(b);
34 CFR 99.31). In particular , this study and the data we are collecting falls
under the ""Organizations Conducting Studies Ex ception"" under 34 CFR
99.31(a)(6), which permits educational institutions to pro vide the same
information they could to go vernment institutions to independent
organizations. Further , as all information will be de-identified b y the district,
we will not be receiving an y student -level PII. If the district requires that weinclude a consent form, then with the district ’s permission, we will use a
passiv e consent process for data collection of administr ative student lev el
data. This will in volve sending parents and guardians the consent letter and
providing instructions for how to opt their child out of the study . 
Confidentialit y. The study team will protect the full priv acy and
confidentialit y of all data collected for the study and will use it for research
purposes only . All data requests will not include data elements, sensitiv e
questions, or questions that would enable identification of individuals. The
majorit y of the data will be administr ative data collected from the district.
Students will not be contacted b y any member of the study team, nor will
they be ask ed to complete an y tasks that are not a part of their normal da y-
to-da y educational activities. No student lev el PII will be giv en to the study
team, as all student lev el data will be de-identified before being sent to us.
The only personally identifiable information collected in the teacher surv ey
include respondent ’s name and email address to allow the study team to
send them the gift card incentiv e. The data used b y the rest of the project
team will ha ve a randomly gener ated identification number as the only
identifier on the file. All data securit y, stor age, and destruction procedures
described in this application will be followed to ensure subject confidentialit y
and anon ymity is protected. 
We shall protect respondent priv acy to the extent permitted b y law and will
comply with all F ederal and Departmental regulations for priv ate
information. W e have dev eloped a Data Securit y Plan that assesses all
protections of respondents’ personally identifiable information. W e will
ensure all our emplo yees who perform work under this contr act and
subcontr act receiv e training on data priv acy issues and comply with the
above requirements. All Mathematica staff must sign an agreement to
maintain the priv acy of an y information from individuals, businesses,
organizations, or families participating in an y projects conducted b y

Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
 
The goals of the ev aluation are to understand (1) how network inno vations
are implementing the inno vation as they scale, (2) the conditions that
support the successful scaling and adoption of network inno vations, and (3)
the outcomes the network inno vations are producing. W e will analyz e
quantitativ e and qualitativ e data to answer the research questions (See
Exhibit 2 for research questions).  
Scaling and implementation analysis: W e will explore k ey aspects of
implementation using a descriptiv e approach. The approach will include
reporting on descriptiv e information about the reach of the inno vation, the
fidelit y of implementation, and teachers’ perspectiv e about k ey aspects of
the inno vation and its implementation. The implementation and scaling
research will focus on the participating schools for the LEAP progr am, and
specifically the school teams leading the implementation of LEAP and the
students enrolled in a class taught b y a school team teacher . We will collect
student classroom enrollment data, surv ey data from school team teachers,
and artifact data from LEAP Inno vations (specifically , sign-in sheet data for
PD workshop sessions for school team teachers).
Student outcome analysis: W e will explore student outcomes using a quasi-
experimental approach. The sample of students included in the analysis of
student outcomes are students enrolled in a class taught b y a school teams
teacher (the treatment group) and students not enrolled in a class taught b y
a school team teacher (the comparison group). W e plan to examine
students’ a verage attendance r ate for the school y ear and students’ reading
and math scores on the i-R eady (for 2nd gr aders) or R enaissance Star
assessment (for 3rd through 8th gr aders) as the student outcomes for the
analysis. W e will compare these outcomes between students enrolled in a
class taught b y a school teams teacher and similar students not enrolled in a
class taught b y a school teams teacher but enrolled at the same school.
Treatment students will be matched to a similar pool of comparison students
using propensit y score matching, a t ype of matched-comparison approach.
Students will be matched within schools based on student char acteristics
(for example, r ace, gender , socioeconomic status) and students’ baseline
scores on a benchmark assessment. Although the problem of pr actice could
vary across schools (reading, math, attendance, student engagement, SEL
outcomes, and teacher outcomes), the progr am’s PD support around
personaliz ed learning could lead to impro vements in multiple student
outcomes. T o address the realit y of different problems of pr actice, we will
estimate a single linear regression model where the outcome will be a
normaliz ed measure of reading, math, or attendance depending on the
problem of pr actice at the treatment student ’s school. The approach of
matching treatment students to a pool of similar comparison students will be
the same. If there is not a sufficient sample of comparison students within
or across the schools implementing LEAP (for example, because all
classrooms in a gr ade lev el at a school are classrooms taught b y a schoolteam teacher), we will dr aw the sample of comparison students from other
schools in the district."

A final ev aluation report w as written and presented to BGCC, which included
results from the 2022-2023 parent, teacher , and student surv eys. This report
also included student demogr aphics collected as part of the data request for
participating schools. W e are currently collecting student, parent and

View xForm - Research Review Board (RRB) SubmissionPreliminary Results to Date
An element that stood out in the 2022-2023 ev aluation, just as in past y ears,
is the caring and meaningful relationships between students and Club staff .
These relationships are important elements of students feeling comfortable
asking for homework help , learning new things, returning to club , and
deepening their motiv ations to come to school and get good gr ades. This
robust and continuous abilit y of BGCC to pro vide these caring relationships to
students sets the stage for these further objectiv es to be met. Additional
progr am strengths to note include:
• Offering a v ariety of activities to participating students
• Students associate clubs with homework help , educational games, and a
place where they engage in interesting activities. A handful of parents also
expressed appreciation that staff help students when they forget to bring
their homework.
• Sports and ph ysical activities, including pla ying outside, stood out a lot this
year as parts of BGCC that students really enjo y and that parents v alue as
part of their children’ s physical health.
• Staff continue to be creativ e and think of different w ays for not only
students but their parents and families as well
• Parents also v oiced appreciation for BGCC's pro vision of a space and
structure for students to socializ e and dev elop their social-emotional skills.
As far as areas for growth, the following ideas arose from the data:
• Children expressed concern about bullies. Children need to feel comfortable
and safe. There were fewer comments this y ear about bullies, suggesting
that Clubs ha ve already done significant work to decrease bullying. The data
suggests, howev er, that this is still an important area for growth.
• A number of parents suggested that there is still room for their
relationships with their children to grow and impro ve.
Recommendations
- Continue centering relationships and the social-emotional well-being of
students. So much of the success of this progr am seems to grow from the
students’ ha ving these trusted staff members in their liv es.
- Continue strengthening anti-bullying progr ams. Data suggests that bullying
decreased since the last school y ear but has not disappeared.
- Strengthen relationships with teachers, when possible, to further
collabor ate on supporting students academically and social-emotionally .
- Consider collabor ating with other BGCC Clubs and neighborhood institutions
to offer more div erse recreational activities and communit y visits while
strengthening ties to communities.
- Track supportiv e wraparound services that students receiv e and their
extracurricular in volvement to ensure students with the most need are high-
priorit y during recruitment.Type of Request

The study addresses four interconnected research questions: 
1.
What is the impact of remo ving one or both SROs on student outcomes (e.g.
attendance; students’ lik elihood of being written up , suspended, expelled, or
arrested in school), students’ perceptions of safet y, and teachers’ perceptions of
safety?
2.

Findings from previous studies on the role and impact of school resource officers on
students' outcomes and experiences are mix ed. Mix ed evidence par allels a robust public
debate about the role of police officers in schools. In Chicago , as in other major urban
school districts, the presence and beha vior of police officers in schools has become a point
of contention between district officials, communit y members, student activists, and police,
particularly in the w ake of the murder of George Flo yd. At the core of these debates are
empirical questions about the w ays in which the presence and/or remo val of SROs from
schools ma y affect student outcomes and experiences, particularly in the realm of
discipline (e.g. students' lik elihood of being written up , suspended out of school, expelled
from school, or arrested in school) and perceiv ed safet y.

Procedures are outlined for these groups below:
1. Centr al Office Staff Interviews W e plan to conduct interviews with 5-10 staff members in CPS'
Centr al Office, beginning with personnel whose responsibilities include coordination, monitoring,
and/or support for CDO enactment in schools. Centr al Office interviews will elicit information
about the scope and nature of CDO implementation in and across schools, trends in student
participation and completion, the o verarching goals of WBL and career dev elopment
progr amming in CPS , and alignment between OCCS initiativ es and other district priorities.
Interviews will require appro ximately 60 minutes of participants' time and will be scheduled for
a date, time, and location of their choice.
2 and 3. W e will conduct interviews with school leaders/principals and k ey progr am staff to
document the t ypes of career dev elopment progr amming at their schools and to understand the
goals for curricular implementation. Interviews will also be used to surface school-lev el factors
that ma y inform the dynamics and outcomes of CDO implementation at the site (e.g. , support
from partners or network teams, resource allocation, staffing). Questions ma y also elicit
leaders' experiences with and needs for centr alized resources and/or support in the enactment
of CDOs. Interviews will require appro ximately 1 hour of participants' time, and will be
scheduled for a date, time, and location of their choice.
4. Interviews with staff from career dev elopment -focused partnership organizations will be used
to establish context surrounding schools' engagement with external partners. Interview
questions will target organizations' goals and purposes for entering into CD partnerships with
schools. P artnership staff will also be ask ed to describe their role in designing and implementing
WBL and CTE progr am activities. Interviews will require appro ximately 60 minutes of

The UChicago Consortium, in partnership with the Illinois W orkforce and Education R esearch
Collabor ative (IWERC) and the Office of College and Career Success (OCCS) are conducting a
study examining the scope of career dev elopment opportunities a vailable to CPS students. The
research will unfold in two phases: a one- year, mixed methods explor atory study – the purpose
of which is to deliv er a “field scan” or landscape summary of the career dev elopment
opportunities (CDOs) associated with Career and T echnical Education (CTE) and W ork Based
Learning (WBL). Qualitativ e interviews will be used to document the v arious t ypes, common
features, and core activities of CDOs. District administr ative data will be used to analyz e
student participation and progr am outcomes. T ogether , evidence will be used to describe CPS
students’ engagement in these opportunities – and the extent to which access differs across
schools and communities. Findings from the explor atory phase of the project will also inform the
design of a causal study focused on a to-be-determined CDO – the goal of which is to pro vide
the district – and field at large – insights to guide policy , resource allocation, and
implementation of related progr amming.
Collectiv ely, this research will mak e a significant contribution to the CTE liter ature b y
documenting the v arious t ypes of CDOs currently enacted in Chicago Public Schools, and
providing timely evidence to policymak ers, district leaders and schools focused on impro ving
and scaling progr ams that promote economic mobilit y and student success in the workforce.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
** PLEA SE NO TE: The research protocol outlined in this RRB application comprises the
qualitativ e strand of the Y ear 1 explor atory study . The o verarching project is a four -year, mixed
methods study with two phases (described abo ve). The research questions below correspond
with the qualitativ e investigation, only . Our project team’ s Scope of W ork outlines the questions
framing the quantitativ e analysis.
1. What are the components of CDOs, including CTE coursework and WBL, as defined b y CPS
district leaders and how are they enacted in schools?
a. How do district, network, school, and progr am administr ators, teachers, and others who
implement CDOs understand and enact their components?
b. How does enactment of CDO components v ary across school and network settings and
progr am char acteristics?
The goal of this work is explor atory and descriptiv e. No formal h ypothesis exists.
We will begin b y interviewing CPS district leaders to gain clarit y around the core components of
CTE and WBL, and to understand broadly how they are enacted b y schools across the district.
We are interested in learning about formal CTE path way progr ams, WBL, and other student -
focused Career Dev elopment Activities that are a vailable to students in middle gr ades (6-8) and
high school (9-12). Interviews will also elicit perceptions of school and progr am staff related to
specific CDOs and progr ams at their schools. R esponses ma y shed light on participants’
understandings of particular outcomes they attribute to students’ participation in these
progr ams.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is the
contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body of extant
knowledge?
Recent y ears ha ve witnessed a culture shift in secondary education from a nearly singular focus
on “college readiness” tow ard more holistic “college and career readiness. ” Historical divisions
between college and career prepar atory progr amming ha ve brok en down somewhat and school
systems now aim to prepare students to be both college and career ready , rather than tr acking
students to one or the other . At the same time, in part in response to feder al legislation and
funding (P erkins IV and V), CTE progr ams of study ha ve become more coherent and connected
within and across secondary and postsecondary institutions (Hodge et al. , 2020). The shifts in
the deliv ery and goals of CDOs, coupled with adv ances in causal methods signal both a need
and opportunit y to update and expand the liter ature on career prepar ation in secondary schools,
through explor ation of the CDOs being implemented and measurement of progr am impact.
CPS’ Office of College and Career Success pro vides support for two main t ypes of CDOs: high
school CTE coursework (organiz ed into sequences called “CTE P athways”) and WBL, which
encompasses a continuum of experiences r anging from career a wareness ev ents to explicit
career prepar ation via internships in high school. Some CTE P athways include WBL as a
component. Our explor atory study will document the r ange of CTE and WBL offered across the
district and (quantitativ ely) examine access to and participation in these CDOs, with an explicit
focus on r acial and geogr aphic equit y across Chicago .
High school CTE participation has grown, nationally , since the early 2010s, but participation
gaps b y gender , economic disadv antage, and school settings ha ve persisted (Arneson et al. ,
2020; Jacob & Ricks, 2023). There is a noted gap in the liter ature on CDOs in middle gr ades
which this study will address, as CPS is expanding WBL and other CDOs to 6th- 8th gr aders.
Over the last decade, CTE progr am models ha ve shifted to more deliber ately and thoughtfully
integr ate academic and technical coursework, alongside WBL experiences (Malkus, 2019). A
large body of evidence, including studies emplo ying experimental and quasi-experimental
designs, has found that CTE participation impro ves high school attendance (Brunner et al. ,
2023; K emple & Snipes, 2000) and gr aduation r ates (Castellano et al. , 2014; Brunner et al. ,
2023; Cellini, 2006; Cullen et al. , 2005; Dortch, 2014; Doughert y, 2016a, 2018a, 2018b;
Doughert y et al. , 2018; Gottfried & Plasman, 2018; K emple & Willner , 2008; Nield et al. , 2013).
Like vocational education of the past, CTE continues to confer benefits for emplo yment (Cow an
et al., 2019; Ecton & Doughert y, 2021; Doughert y, 2016a, 2018b) and earnings (Brunner et al. ,
2023; Chen et al. , 2020; Ecton & Doughert y, 2021).
The approach and structure of CTE progr ams v ary, and not all progr ams prepare students
equally for success in postsecondary education. Impacts on two- year college enrollment and
completion ha ve gener ally been found to be positiv e (Giani, 2019; Goldring et al. , 2021;
Theobald et al. , 2019; Witz en, 2019), although some studies ha ve found null impacts (Ames,
2022; Cowen et al. , 2019) and others ha ve found negativ e impacts (Ecton & Doughert y, 2021;
Giani, 2019). The liter ature studying impacts on four -year college enrollment and attainment
has been decidedly more mix ed, with sev eral studies finding o verall negativ e impacts (Cow an et
al., 2019; Doughert y, 2018a; Goldring, 2021; Lindsa y et al. , 2021; Witz en, 2019). Studies that
have disaggregated outcomes b y path way and course t ype ha ve found that impacts v ary in siz e
and direction, with positiv e impacts on four -year college-going for students in STEM path ways
(Doughert y, 2018b; Giani, 2019) and education (Ecton & Doughert y, 2021; Giani, 2019) and for
dual enrollment students (Doughert y, 2016b). School t ype ma y also pla y a role in the
magnitude of impacts; students in CTE-dedicated high schools as compared to comprehensiv e
high schools ha ve been found to ha ve higher attendance (Brunner et al. , 2023), gr aduation
rates (Castellano et al. , 2014), and earnings (Ecton & Doughert y, 2021).
Impacts also v ary by student demogr aphic groups. Numerous studies ha ve found that benefits
for high school gr aduation, emplo yment, and earnings are concentr ated in male students
(Brunner et al. , 2023; Doughert y, 2016a; Theodos et al. , 2023), low -income students
(Doughert y, 2016a, 2018a, 2018b), and students with disabilities (Doughert y et al. , 2018;
Jacob & Guardiola, 2022; Theobald et al. , 2019). Using a national sample, Ecton and Doughert y
(2021) ha ve also found higher college enrollment, emplo yment, and earnings among Black and
Latino students and students with low academic achiev ement.
While much of the liter ature is focused on high school CTE course-taking, there is some recent
work on other CDOs, either as components of CTE progr ams or otherwise. Giani (2022) showsmixed results on the relationship between earning an industry -recogniz ed credential (IRC) and
postsecondary education outcomes but a positiv e relationship with short -term earnings and
emplo yment. Further , high school internships were shown to ha ve a positiv e impact on
graduation and college enrollment r ates for male students (Theodos et al. , 2023).
CPS recently embark ed on an ambitious reimagining of its approach to career dev elopment to
standardiz e CTE and WBL offerings and expand access to high-qualit y progr amming across the
city. This effort has included creating career dev elopment experiences for students in middle
grades (e.gs. , CTE summer camps, career explor ation da ys), scaling career connected learning
approaches across secondary progr amming (e.g. , work -based learning), and strengthening
postsecondary tr ansitions for gr aduates (e.g. , Chicago R oadmap).","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated with this
study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will be asked of your
research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
OVERVIEW
We will conduct interviews with district (centr al office) administr ators, school leaders, and CTE /
WBL coordinators to examine and describe the scope and char acter of career dev elopment
opportunities being implemented in CPS . We also anticipate conducting interviews with staff
from a subset of industry organizations or postsecondary institutions whose partnerships with
schools facilitate WBL and hands-on learning experiences. W e plan to collect and review
participant -supplied progr am artifacts (e.g. , course descriptions, course sequences, rubrics,
standards) to contextualiz e individuals’ accounts.
SAMPLING
We will utiliz e a purposiv e sampling str ategy to identif y appro ximately 10 district leaders for
semi-structured interviews, starting with staff in the Office of College and Career Success
(OCCS) who are in volved in visioning and support (e.g. , Director of CTE progr ams) for district -
wide career dev elopment progr amming. In line with the explor atory research design, we plan to
use in referr al sampling (also known as snowball sampling), whereb y participants aid in the
identification of other prospectiv e informants based on their organizational knowledge and
relationships. W e plan to recruit appro ximately 15 school-based staff (incl. school leaders and
CTE progr am leaders) and 5-10 staff from industry / external partnership organizations to
participate in interviews about the goals, structures, and implementation of CDOs. W e will
prioritiz e the representation of div erse school contexts in our sample – targeting v aried student
demogr aphics, school siz e, CPS progr am types, and geogr aphic regions. Giv en the district ’s
goals of CDO expansion in middle gr ades, we intend to recruit participants with first -hand
insights into these plans and activities. R eferral sampling methods will be especially important
for identif ying these informants, as Centr al Office teams ha ve yet to systematically collect data
on the full scope of CDOs in middle gr ades.
INTERVIEWS
We will recruit prospectiv e participants from the named groups to participate in semistructured
interviews with research team members. Interviews will be coordinated directly with
participants and scheduled according to individuals’ a vailabilit y and preferences. W e anticipate
interviews will require appro ximately 60 minutes of participants time. P articipants will be giv en
the choice of interviewing in person or virtually . For virtual interviews, we will utiliz e an end-to-
end encrypted conference platform such as Z oom or Google Meets. With individuals’ permission,
we will record audio from each interview to facilitate tr anscription and ensure the accur acy of
our notes. Data securit y measures are described in the P ermission and Confidentialit y section of
this application.
PROGRAM AR TIFACTS
Simultaneous to interviews, we will collect CDO-related artifacts to contextualiz e participants’
accounts and gain insights into progr am implementation. Artifacts ma y include progr am
descriptions, content and learning standards, sample instructional materials, and partnership
overviews. In addition to publicly a vailable progr am documents, we will also in vite interviewees
to share de-identified progr am documents and materials. (Note: student work will NO T be
collected; we will ask that an y student identifiers be remo ved from documents prior to tr ansfer
to the research team.) Protocols for file tr ansfer between participants and research team are
detailed under the P ermission and Confidentialit y section of this application.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical techniques that
will be utilized as part of this study.
Interview tr anscripts, fieldwork notes, and progr am artifacts will be analyz ed descriptiv ely using
a combination of deductiv e and inductiv e qualitativ e methods. Deductiv e constructs correspond
with prior empirical knowledge, relev ant conceptual fr ameworks, and researchers’ contextual
understandings. W e intend to engage in iter ative cycles of analysis, formativ e knowledge
sharing, and schema revision with the quantitativ e study team to deriv e maximum benefit from
our mix ed methods design.
The o verarching goals of the explor atory study call for both descriptiv e and explanatory
analyses of heterogeneous progr am models/CDOs. W e expect that descriptiv e analysis will
facilitate documentation of v ariabilit y in progr am resources, core components, activities,
participants, and reported outcomes. W e will engage in explanatory analysis to in vestigate
interrelationships between these v ariables and dr aw loose causal chains between progr am
inputs, activities, and focal outcomes. In combination with quantitativ e findings, we anticipate
convergence around a subset of progr ams with the robust infr astructure to support a causal
study .
Analysis will in volve iterative phases of contextual and narr ative analysis (Mischler , 1986) and
thematic interpretation (Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, 2014) for each of the qualitativ e data
sources. W e anticipate the use of select a priori codes, informed b y extant liter ature on
curriculum design and implementation in CTE and WBL (P ark, P earson, & Richardson, 2017).
Inductiv e, context -informed analytic str ategies ma y also be utiliz ed to account for no vel aspects
of CDO implementation and the district ’s underlying theory of change. Structur al and descriptiv e
coding methods will be utiliz ed to segment and categoriz e the corpus of qualitativ e data
according to the research questions and data collection protocols (Saldaña, 2015). W e will
attend especially to how the progr ammatic objectiv es, recruitment str ategies, and participation
structures of different CDOs v ary across networks or schools in w ays that ma y result in
differential access and uptak e across student subgroup populations (Andrews et al. , 2019).
Triangulation of the two data sources (interview tr anscripts and document artifacts) will
facilitate meaningful comparisons and identif y potential discrepancies. Analytic memos will also
be used to link emergent themes across the data sources semantically (Miles et al. , 2014).
Together with data visualization techniques and cross-case analytic str ategies designed to
surface patterns across cases, our analytic approach will identif y components of CDOs in gr ades
6-12 and factors associated with v ariation in how they are implemented.

facilitators, each one engaged a two- year cy cle. The facilitators will be
trained during an institute in the summer of the first y ear and will then
implement the professional dev elopment with 3 – 4 schools during the
subsequent two school y ears.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The study will be focused on the following research questions:
1. What is the impact of the Math for All professional dev elopment on:
- Teachers’ classroom pr actices
- Teachers’ beliefs about teaching mathematics to div erse learners
- Students’ performance on mathematics achiev ement tests
2. How is the Math for All progr am being implemented?
MFA has shown to ha ve a positiv e impact on teachers’ beliefs and student
achiev ement when implemented b y the authors of the progr am. The purpose
of this study is to test the effectiv eness when the progr am is implemented
by other facilitators and to gather information about necessary modifications
to the structure of the progr am when scaled to this degree.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
While there is a great need to impro ve PD efforts, there is little rigorous
evidence a vailable to guide this process. A review of research on teacher PD
(Yoon, Duncan, Lee, Scarloss, & Shapley , 2007) attests to the paucit y of
relevant studies that link PD to student outcomes. What we do know is that
PD that is focused on teachers’ knowledge of academic subject matter and
how students learn that content has been found more lik ely to be related to
changes in classroom pr actices and enhanced student outcomes than
traditional approaches that focus mainly on the processes for deliv ery of
instruction (e.g. , PD on gener al instructional str ategies for supporting
students) (Cohen & Hill, 1998; Corcor an, 1995; Garet, P orter, Desimone,
Birman, & Y oon, 2001; K ennedy , 1998). This suggests that teachers’
competencies for differentiating instruction to meet the needs of all learners
in gener al education classrooms, including those with disabilities, must be
developed in the context of content -focused mathematics PD to ha ve a
significant impact on classroom pr actices and student achiev ement. 
A small number of PD progr ams do integr ate learning about how to
differentiate instruction with learning about mathematics content (e.g. ,
Brodesky , Gross, Mc Tigue, & P almer , 2007; Moeller et al. , 2012). While
small-scale pilot and field tests ha ve accompanied the dev elopment of these
efforts, they ha ve yet to be ev aluated rigorously and on a larger scale.
Research about one of these progr ams, Math for All (MF A) (Moeller et al. ,
2012), has demonstr ated the feasibilit y of its implementation in a v ariety of
different school districts, its promise for impro ving teachers’ knowledge,
skills, and classroom pr actices (Meier et al. , 2008) and students’ learning
outcomes, and the possibilit y that staff dev elopers other than the dev elopers
can implement the progr am with fidelit y (Moeller et al. , 2012).  MF A has
been carefully designed based on a best pr actices model of PD (e.g. ,
Committee on Science and Mathematics T eacher Prepar ation, 2001; Darling-
Hammond et al. , 2009; Loucks-Horsley , Hewson, Lo ve & Stiles, 1998;
Mathematical Sciences Education Board, 2001). R esearch has helped to
refine and lend empirical support for this model. Garet et al. (2001)
identified six core features of PD activities that were related to teachers’
self-reported increases in knowledge and skills and changes in classroom
practice: (1) a focus on content, including the content students learn and
how they learn it; (2) opportunities for activ e learning (e.g. , to pr actice and
reflect on what participants learn and to obtain feedback); (3) coherence
with other learning activities (e.g. , alignment with standards); (4) the
duration of the activit y (e.g. , contact hours, span of time); (5) the form of
the activit y (e.g. , workshop vs. study group); and (6) collectiv e participation
of teachers (e.g. , from the same school, gr ade, or subject). 
The o verall goal of this project is to implement, test, and refine str ategies
for regionally expanding MF A in a v ariety of settings and with div erse high-
need populations in Chicago , and to build local capacit y and infr astructure to
support the sustainabilit y and continued expansion of the progr am after this
project ends. Building on Coburn’ s  (2003) fr amework for scale, our
strategies are designed to support the depth, sustainabilit y, spread, and shiftto local ownership of MF A, and include (1) tr aining of local staff dev elopers
and teacher leaders as facilitators of the progr am, (2) inclusion of school
leaders in the PD for facilitators and teachers, and (3) integr ation of MF A
into the existing PD structures that are part of teachers’ regular work
schedules. R esearch efforts are designed to yield formativ e findings to help
refine the scale-up str ategies, pro vide evidence about MF A’s effectiv eness in
a variety of settings and for div erse student populations.","to Date

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Developed b y Education Dev elopment Center , Inc (EDC) and Bank Street
College and published b y Corwin Press, Math for All (MF A) is a professional
development progr am that has shown promise for positiv ely affecting
teachers and students.  MF A prepares K -5th gr ade teachers to help students
with div erse strengths and needs – including those with disabilities – in
gener al education classrooms to achiev e high-qualit y, standards-based
outcomes in mathematics.  The proposed study will conduct a r andomiz ed
controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of MF A and is designed to
investigate the impact of the PD progr am on teachers’ knowledge and
classroom pr actices as well as its effect on student academic achiev ement in
mathematics. Additionally , this EIR scale-up project will build capacit y for
MFA and its expansion b y preparing local facilitators to lead the PD and
school leaders to support implementation. F acilitators will be local staff
developers (ISLs, content and div erse learning specialists, instructional
coaches, etc.) who will lead PD with teachers at the schools. T raining local
facilitators helps districts build internal capacit y and ownership of the
interv ention, and enables them to spread the use of MF A within and across
schools o ver time. F or this project, we will recruit 3 cohorts of schools and
facilitators, each one engaged a two- year cy cle. The facilitators will be
trained during an institute in the summer of the first y ear and will then
implement the professional dev elopment with 3 – 4 schools during the
subsequent two school y ears.  Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The study will be focused on the following research questions:
1. What is the impact of the Math for All professional dev elopment on:
- Teachers’ classroom pr actices
- Teachers’ beliefs about teaching mathematics to div erse learners
- Students’ performance on mathematics achiev ement tests
2. How is the Math for All progr am being implemented?
MFA has shown to ha ve a positiv e impact on teachers’ beliefs and student
achiev ement when implemented b y the authors of the progr am. The purpose
of this study is to test the effectiv eness when the progr am is implemented
by other facilitators and to gather information about necessary modifications
to the structure of the progr am when scaled to this degree. Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
While there is a great need to impro ve PD efforts, there is little rigorous
evidence a vailable to guide this process. A review of research on teacher PD
(Yoon, Duncan, Lee, Scarloss, & Shapley , 2007) attests to the paucit y of
relevant studies that link PD to student outcomes. What we do know is that
PD that is focused on teachers’ knowledge of academic subject matter and
how students learn that content has been found more lik ely to be related to
changes in classroom pr actices and enhanced student outcomes than
traditional approaches that focus mainly on the processes for deliv ery of
instruction (e.g. , PD on gener al instructional str ategies for supporting
students) (Cohen & Hill, 1998; Corcor an, 1995; Garet, P orter, Desimone,
Birman, & Y oon, 2001; K ennedy , 1998). This suggests that teachers’
competencies for differentiating instruction to meet the needs of all learners
in gener al education classrooms, including those with disabilities, must be
developed in the context of content -focused mathematics PD to ha ve a
significant impact on classroom pr actices and student achiev ement. 
A small number of PD progr ams do integr ate learning about how to
differentiate instruction with learning about mathematics content (e.g. ,
Brodesky , Gross, Mc Tigue, & P almer , 2007; Moeller et al. , 2012). While
small-scale pilot and field tests ha ve accompanied the dev elopment of these
efforts, they ha ve yet to be ev aluated rigorously and on a larger scale.
Research about one of these progr ams, Math for All (MF A) (Moeller et al. ,
2012), has demonstr ated the feasibilit y of its implementation in a v ariety of
different school districts, its promise for impro ving teachers’ knowledge,
skills, and classroom pr actices (Meier et al. , 2008) and students’ learning
outcomes, and the possibilit y that staff dev elopers other than the dev elopers
can implement the progr am with fidelit y (Moeller et al. , 2012).  MF A has
been carefully designed based on a best pr actices model of PD (e.g. ,
Committee on Science and Mathematics T eacher Prepar ation, 2001; Darling-
Hammond et al. , 2009; Loucks-Horsley , Hewson, Lo ve & Stiles, 1998;
Mathematical Sciences Education Board, 2001). R esearch has helped to
refine and lend empirical support for this model. Garet et al. (2001)
identified six core features of PD activities that were related to teachers’
self-reported increases in knowledge and skills and changes in classroom
practice: (1) a focus on content, including the content students learn and
how they learn it; (2) opportunities for activ e learning (e.g. , to pr actice and
reflect on what participants learn and to obtain feedback); (3) coherence
with other learning activities (e.g. , alignment with standards); (4) the
duration of the activit y (e.g. , contact hours, span of time); (5) the form of
the activit y (e.g. , workshop vs. study group); and (6) collectiv e participation
of teachers (e.g. , from the same school, gr ade, or subject). 
The o verall goal of this project is to implement, test, and refine str ategies
for regionally expanding MF A in a v ariety of settings and with div erse high-
need populations in Chicago , and to build local capacit y and infr astructure to
support the sustainabilit y and continued expansion of the progr am after this
project ends. Building on Coburn’ s  (2003) fr amework for scale, our
strategies are designed to support the depth, sustainabilit y, spread, and shiftto local ownership of MF A, and include (1) tr aining of local staff dev elopers
and teacher leaders as facilitators of the progr am, (2) inclusion of school
leaders in the PD for facilitators and teachers, and (3) integr ation of MF A
into the existing PD structures that are part of teachers’ regular work
schedules. R esearch efforts are designed to yield formativ e findings to help
refine the scale-up str ategies, pro vide evidence about MF A’s effectiv eness in
a variety of settings and for div erse student populations. 
Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
The study design is a R andomiz ed Control T rial (RCT) in which participating
schools will be r andomly assigned to be pro vided the PD at either the K -2 or
the 3-5 gr ade band. All teachers at the school will be ask ed to complete the

Additionally , we will tr ain 2 teacher leaders at each site as facilitators. These
individuals will be ask ed to adapt the PD for the local context and to
complete a log to document an y adaptations they implemented so we can
understand fidelit y of implementation.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
1. To assess the impact of the Math for All professional dev elopment, we will
collect data from teachers who participate in the Math for All professional
development and from a comparison group of teachers who participate in
business- as-usual professional dev elopment. P articipating schools ha ve the
option to select the gr ade band (K -2 or gr ades 3-5) for which they would lik e
to receiv e the Math for All professional dev elopment. T eachers in the gr ade
band (K -2 or gr ades 3-5) not participating in the PD will serv e in the
comparison group .
To assess impact on teachers’ classroom pr actices, we will collect teaching
logs from teachers.
To assess the impact on teachers’ beliefs about teaching mathematics to
diverse learners we will administer three surv eys.
To assess the impact of the Math for All professional dev elopment progr am
we will request and analyz e scores from standardiz ed mathematics
achiev ement tests that are being administered b y CPS schools. W e have
established a data sharing agreement with CPS to obtain access to this data.
 2. To document the fidelit y of implementation of Math for All and to
establish a treatment contr ast with the comparison group , we will dr aw on
multiple data sources. T o document fidelit y at the classroom lev el, we will
use data from teacher logs. T o document the fidelit y of the implementation
of the Math for All professional dev elopment, we will dr aw on multiple data
sources to establish the dosage, adherence, participant responsiv eness, and
differentiation between the Math for All and comparison group teachers.
Data sources will include teachers’ attendance records and teacher feedback
forms completed at the end of professional dev elopment sessions. W e will
also collect data from teacher leaders (facilitators-in-tr aining), including two
surveys, facilitator logs after each PD session, and collect feedback forms
after facilitator PD sessions.
Data Analysis Plan
1. To assess the impact of the Math for All professional dev elopment, we will
conduct descriptiv e analyses (e.g. , counts, frequencies, group means),
correlational analyses, and multilev el modeling of the teacher and student
data. These quantitativ e analyses will be complemented b y qualitativ e data
from open-ended questions in the teacher surv eys and logs.
2. To document the fidelit y of implementation of Math for All and to establish
a treatment contr ast with the comparison group , we will conduct descriptiv e
analyses of facilitator surv eys and logs. Qualitativ e data will be analyz ed
thematically and coded."

How can we increase the number of CPS neighborhood schools that offer AP CSP?
We will examine the role of principals and other school personnel in creating access to AP CSP .","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is the
contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body of extant
knowledge?
While AP CSP w as dev eloped to attr act broader participation of students underrepresented in
computer science coursework, access to AP CSP within CPS remains limited, despite the
existence of ECS in ev ery CPS high school. Unfortunately , there are too man y CPS schools
where students do not ha ve access to additional computer science courses. This is particularly
acute for AP computer science, where, lik e other AP subject areas, r acial and ethnic disparities
remain in terms of access and outcomes. Eight of the elev en specializ ed, selectiv e enrollment
CPS high schools offer AP CSP . In contr ast, only about one quarter of the 82 CPS neighborhood
high schools offer AP CSP , and these schools serv e higher percentages of African American and
Hispanic students than the selectiv e schools do . Furthermore, despite the efficacy of ECS in
preparing students for AP-lev el computer science, there still remain significant differences in AP
outcomes between white and Asian students, and African American and Hispanic students.
Disparities in AP access and outcomes b y race and ethnicit y are not unique to computer science.
Kolluri’ s (2018) review of AP research across disciplines found two v ariables that are
consistently correlated with the probabilit y that a school offers an y AP classes. (a) School
enrollment: smaller schools (<1,250 students) are much less lik ely to offer an y AP classes
compared to medium and large schools. Furthermore, those small schools that do offer AP are
only able to pro vide limited AP options. (b) T est scores: the number of students at a school with
high 8th gr ade standardiz ed assessment scores is correlated with the probabilit y of a school
offering an AP class. The majorit y of African American and Hispanic students in CPS attend
neighborhood schools that, on a verage, tend to be smaller and ha ve fewer students with high
8th gr ade assessments scores than selectiv e enrollment schools. Thus, the majorit y of African
American and Hispanic students attend schools with significant barriers to offering AP courses.
While school siz e and prior achiev ement of the student body influence the probabilit y that
schools offer an y AP classes at all, there is little research on how these factors influence which
AP courses are offered within schools that do offer AP . In a study of curriculum decision-making
in large vs. small high schools, Lee et al. (2000) found that high schools balance the interests of
students with the resources  available to pro vide options. Large schools tend to ha ve the
resources to pro vide man y course options for students, but there can be significant disparities in
who accesses adv anced course offerings lik e AP classes. On the other hand, as a result of
limited resources, small schools focus on offering the core courses and ha ve difficult y providing
additional options, lik e AP.","and Student/Staff Involvement

The purpose of the research, funded b y the National Science F oundation, is
to learn from an effort to support y outh participatory science (YPS) projects
in high school science classes. A multiple case study design will be used to
study the synergistic learning that occurs as teachers, students, scientists,
and communit y members work together on addressing complex socio-
scientific issues (S SI). Specifically , this study is concerned with the context -
specific science content knowledge that teachers construct and bridge with
students' funds of knowledge to address scientific problems lacking clear
solutions. The intersection of these forms of knowledge redefine the concept
of pedagogical content knowledge for the 21st century in a w ay that
prioritiz es communit y-responsiv e teaching through authentic scientific
problems. Data for this study will be collected during the planning and
implementation of YPS in three annual cy cles. Data sources include work
artifacts produced b y teachers and students, audio or video recordings of
classes, instructional planning meetings, public presentations of y outh
participatory science projects, and interviews with select teachers and

scientific concepts, pr actices, and ideas in rich and connected w ays by
engaging in YPS projects in their communities. These YPS projects will be
supported b y partnerships with scientists and communit y organizations and
the research question also requires an examination of the nature of these
partnerships.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
 
Research indicates that contextualizing science concepts within
socioscientific issues (S SI) has a positiv e impact on students’ interest,
motiv ation, and content learning (Sadler & Da wson, 2012; Sadler , Romine, &
Topçu, 2016). The notion of S SI contextualization is complicated in urban
schools where students often feel alienated b y science pedagogy that is not
well aligned with their experiences and S SI exist that are particular to urban
contexts (Emdin, 2010). Bang and her colleagues (2010) demonstr ated the
effectiv eness of cultur ally-based science education and communit y-based
research in engaging underrepresented y outh in science learning.
3-Dimensional  Interdisciplinary  Learning  through  Authentic
Community  Investigations
An ambitious vision for science education in the US in the 21  Century has
been laid out in the reports A Framework  for K-12 Science  Education  and the
subsequent Next Gener ation Science Standards (NRC, 2012; NGS S Lead
States, 2013). This vision acknowledges the ongoing importance of
“disciplinary core ideas” while pushing tow ards an interdisciplinary approach
with “science and engineering pr actices” and “cross-cutting concepts. ” The
NGSS place increased emphasis on Earth and en vironmental sciences and
advocate substantial attention to human impacts on Earth systems for the
purposes of understanding and realizing sustainabilit y. The Framework  also
includes a response to previous critiques of science standards (R odriguez,
1997) with a renewed focus on issues of div ersity and equit y. In so doing,
the Framework echoes previous work (McDermott & W eber, 1998;
Aikenhead, 2006) in which it w as asserted that “science education should
provide all students with the background to systematically in vestigate issues
related to their personal and communit y priorities” (NRC, 2012, p . 278). This
project studies teaching that realiz es these components of the NGS S vision
in urban high school chemistry classrooms through authentic science
investigations. 
Youth  Participatory  Science : Combining  Youth  Participatory  Action
Research  with Citizen  Science
      Citizen science is a crowd-sourcing approach to scientific data collection
that has become populariz ed in ecological studies as a w ay to extend data
collection bey ond the capacit y of small research teams while also engaging
the public more directly with important scientific and en vironmental
concerns (Irwin, 1995). Y outh participatory science (YPS) pushes bey ond the
boundaries of citiz en science b y viewing y outh, communit y members, and
teachers not just as samplers or data collectors, but also in the dev elopment
of localiz ed questions, in the analysis of data, and in the dissemination of
results. These contributions will build on previous findings that “street
science, ” which builds on local knowledge in urban communities, is impactfulstin addressing en vironmental health problems in disin vested neighborhoods
(Corburn, 2005). In this w ay, this project is also informed b y Youth
Participatory Action R esearch or YP AR (Cammarota & Fine, 2008). YP AR
combines pedagogy , research, and y outh dev elopment to engage y oung
people in learning about and addressing problems that impact their liv es.
Whereas YP AR has mostly emplo yed social science methods, YPS combines
the participatory elements of YP AR with the natur al sciences methods of
citizen science.
Substantial  Demands  on Teachers & Re-imagining Pedagogical
Content Knowledge
Whereas the vision laid out b y the NRC Fr amework and NGS S is bold and the
concept of YPS is promising as a means for achieving that vision,
transforming science education in such a dr amatic manor implies substantial
demands on teachers. The science education research communit y has begun
to tak e on the task of supporting and advising teachers. The white papers on
NGSS issued b y NARST , a worldwide organization for impro ving science
teaching through research, pro vide sev eral examples (L ynch & Bry an, 2014).
Another example comes from Kr ajcik and colleagues (2014) who proposed a
ten-step process for planning to “scaffold the dev elopment of the [NGS S
performance expectations]” (p . 162). Step nine in this process suggests that
teachers, “carefully construct a storyline to help learners build sophisticated
ideas from prior ideas using evidence that builds to the understanding
described in the PEs (p . 163). The process as a whole is promising for
supporting teachers as they bundle NGS S performance expectations (PEs),
work to understand their nuances and relationships, and then construct
“lesson lev el” versions of the PEs. Howev er, engaging with authentic
scientific problems in communit y contexts is sufficiently unpredictable to
make “carefully construct[ing] a storyline” unachiev able. In fact, the
demands on teachers to be responsiv e to who their students are and to how
science is useful in communities requires a different set of knowledge than
they ha ve traditionally been expected to build. More accur ately, science
teachers must adopt a different stance tow ards content knowledge and their
own learning. Thus, this project will empirically re-examine the concept of
pedagogical content knowledge in the context of the NGS S and ev er more
diverse student populations.
            Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Shulman, 1986) describes the
unique t ype of knowledge at the intersection of pedagogy and content and
includes “the w ays of representing and formulating the subject that mak e it
comprehensible to others” and “the conceptions and preconceptions that
students of different ages and backgrounds bring with them to the learning”
(Shulman, 1986, p . 9). As YPS aims to engage div erse students with
authentic scientific problems, both components of pedagogical content
knowledge are more complex. R esearch has shown that the scientific
knowledge required to address S SI in a local context, or “need-to-know
science, ” often does not o verlap directly with the canonical science t ypically
included in school curricula (Aik enhead, 2006). As science teachers learn
this “need-to-know science” to prepare for instruction, their pedagogical
content knowledge is lik ely to be further challenged b y the 3-dimensional
design of the NGS S.Drawing on students’ funds of knowledge is an important pr actice in
educating students, especially those from non-dominant cultur al
backgrounds (NRC, 2012; Calabrese Barton & T an, 2009). This extends
Shulman’ s emphasis on “the conceptions…that students of different…
backgrounds bring with them” (p . 9) bey ond prior school knowledge to also
consider the knowledge that resides in students’ homes and families.
Engaging div erse students with authentic scientific in vestigations in the
communit y requires that teachers learn additional scientific content (need-
to-know science) and dev elop str ategies for dr awing on students’ funds of
knowledge. As these two additional forms of knowledge intersect with the
pedagogical demands of the NGS S, we are challenged to reconsider
pedagogical content knowledge for the 21  century project of teaching 3-
dimensional science in increasingly div erse U .S. schools. This project will
address the challenge of reimagining pedagogical content knowledge b y
leveraging partnerships to support synergistic learning between teachers,
students, communities, and scientists. This project will study this learning,
with a focus on teachers’ learning, dev elopment, and pr actices.

by the pandemic school closures in spring 2020 and the entire project w as
put on hold with the continuation of distance learning for much of 2021-22.
But we resumed supporting YPS Projects in 2022 and hosted YPS
conferences in Ma y 2022 (at UIC) and in Ma y 2023 (h ybrid). Most of our
data collection has focused on teacher learning in the form of recordings of
teacher interviews and planning institutes. These activities ha ve occurred
outside of school time (after school, during winter break, or during summer
break). W e have also collected some student data including a limited

View xForm - Research Review Board (RRB) SubmissionPreliminary Results to Date
We collected qualitativ e data about three planning institutes and two cy cles
of YPS projects in CPS schools. As a result of our initial work in those
institutes, we dev eloped and published a curriculum fr amework for YPS
projects and also an analysis of how the Next Gener ation Science Standards
align with YPS . We have analyz ed data from the first two institutes. While we
were initially focused on teachers’ learning of science content, we found that
teachers also ha ve to do substantial learning about history and civics in
order to lead YPS projects in science classrooms. In an elabor ation of these
findings, we ha ve learned that teachers learning the histories of scientific
industries can be an important facet of planning science projects for civic
engagement. W e have also found that designing professional dev elopment
based on teachers’ structured and collectiv e reflections on their pr actice w as
effectiv e for targeting the specific historical and interdisciplinary learning
required to lead YPS projects.

Classroom Artifacts
InterviewsPlease describe your classroom artifact collection protocol, detailing
when, where, duration, frequency, and with whom? 
This study focuses on YPS projects and therefore classroom artifact
collection will be limited to lessons identified b y participating teachers as
especially relev ant to the YPS projects they are facilitating in their
classroom. W e do not expect the frequency of classroom data collection to
surpass 10 school da ys of lessons o ver the course of a y ear. These da ys ma y
be concentr ated during a single unit of instruction or ma y be spread out o ver
the course of a quarter or semester , depending on the teachers’ design for
the project.
Classroom artifacts, including student work and instructional materials
produced b y teachers will be collected digitally whenev er possible. T eachers
will upload only relev ant artifacts to a secure Bo x folder where only the PI
and UIC research personnel would ha ve access. R esearch personnel will
cross-check artifacts with records of consent and delete artifacts from
students who did not consent while tr ansferring artifacts from consenting
students to a separ ate secure Bo x folder . If a teacher identifies hard cop y
work artifacts as relev ant to their project, they will giv e the artifacts to a
researcher . The researcher will determine which of the artifacts belong to
consented participants and only scan or cop y those artifacts before returning
the entire set to the teacher . Scanned or copied artifacts will be de-identified
by replacing an y student, teacher , or school names with pseudon yms.
We propose resuming our originally appro ved protocols for making audio or
video recordings of a small sample of lessons. This recording would be
conducted b y a researcher with lev el II clear ance from CPS only in
classrooms where 85% of students ha ve consented to participate. Non-
consenting students would be omitted from recordings b y the researcher
during collection and/or blurred from an y video recordings soon thereafter .
The v erbal contributions of non-consenting students will not be included in
transcripts of class recordings.
Please describe how data will be captured and stored securely
Teacher and student work artifacts will be collected as described abo ve in the
form of a hardcop y or digital file and stored securely in a UIC Bo x folder that
is shared only between the project PI and authoriz ed researchers listed on
the UIC protocol. Hardcop y data will be digitiz ed or copied as indicated
above, de-identified, and stored in lock ed, secure stor age in the PI’ s lock ed
office at UIC. A udio and video recordings will be made on PGP-encrypted
portable devices and tr ansferred to secure serv er space, secure folders on

Study OverviewExecutive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of
the motivation, design, and implications of the project.
The purpose of the research, funded b y the National Science F oundation, is
to learn from an effort to support y outh participatory science (YPS) projects
in high school science classes. A multiple case study design will be used to
study the synergistic learning that occurs as teachers, students, scientists,
and communit y members work together on addressing complex socio-
scientific issues (S SI). Specifically , this study is concerned with the context -
specific science content knowledge that teachers construct and bridge with
students' funds of knowledge to address scientific problems lacking clear
solutions. The intersection of these forms of knowledge redefine the concept
of pedagogical content knowledge for the 21st century in a w ay that
prioritiz es communit y-responsiv e teaching through authentic scientific
problems. Data for this study will be collected during the planning and
implementation of YPS in three annual cy cles. Data sources include work
artifacts produced b y teachers and students, audio or video recordings of
classes, instructional planning meetings, public presentations of y outh
participatory science projects, and interviews with select teachers and
students. The findings of this project will inform the education of secondary
science teachers and the dev elopment of partnerships to create participatory
opportunities for y outh in meaningful communit y-based science
investigations.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The main research question addressed b y this study is: How can
partnerships support interdisciplinary science teaching through YPS b y
creating opportunities for the synergistic learning of high school teachers
and students? W e expect students and teachers to learn interdisciplinary
scientific concepts, pr actices, and ideas in rich and connected w ays by
engaging in YPS projects in their communities. These YPS projects will be
supported b y partnerships with scientists and communit y organizations and
the research question also requires an examination of the nature of these
partnerships. Purpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
 
Research indicates that contextualizing science concepts within
socioscientific issues (S SI) has a positiv e impact on students’ interest,
motiv ation, and content learning (Sadler & Da wson, 2012; Sadler , Romine, &
Topçu, 2016). The notion of S SI contextualization is complicated in urban
schools where students often feel alienated b y science pedagogy that is not
well aligned with their experiences and S SI exist that are particular to urban
contexts (Emdin, 2010). Bang and her colleagues (2010) demonstr ated the
effectiv eness of cultur ally-based science education and communit y-based
research in engaging underrepresented y outh in science learning.
3-Dimensional  Interdisciplinary  Learning  through  Authentic
Community  Investigations
An ambitious vision for science education in the US in the 21  Century has
been laid out in the reports A Framework  for K-12 Science  Education  and the
subsequent Next Gener ation Science Standards (NRC, 2012; NGS S Lead
States, 2013). This vision acknowledges the ongoing importance of
“disciplinary core ideas” while pushing tow ards an interdisciplinary approach
with “science and engineering pr actices” and “cross-cutting concepts. ” The
NGSS place increased emphasis on Earth and en vironmental sciences and
advocate substantial attention to human impacts on Earth systems for the
purposes of understanding and realizing sustainabilit y. The Framework  also
includes a response to previous critiques of science standards (R odriguez,
1997) with a renewed focus on issues of div ersity and equit y. In so doing,
the Framework echoes previous work (McDermott & W eber, 1998;
Aikenhead, 2006) in which it w as asserted that “science education should
provide all students with the background to systematically in vestigate issues
related to their personal and communit y priorities” (NRC, 2012, p . 278). This
project studies teaching that realiz es these components of the NGS S vision
in urban high school chemistry classrooms through authentic science
investigations. 
Youth  Participatory  Science : Combining  Youth  Participatory  Action
Research  with Citizen  Science
      Citizen science is a crowd-sourcing approach to scientific data collection
that has become populariz ed in ecological studies as a w ay to extend data
collection bey ond the capacit y of small research teams while also engaging
the public more directly with important scientific and en vironmental
concerns (Irwin, 1995). Y outh participatory science (YPS) pushes bey ond the
boundaries of citiz en science b y viewing y outh, communit y members, and
teachers not just as samplers or data collectors, but also in the dev elopment
of localiz ed questions, in the analysis of data, and in the dissemination of
results. These contributions will build on previous findings that “street
science, ” which builds on local knowledge in urban communities, is impactfulstin addressing en vironmental health problems in disin vested neighborhoods
(Corburn, 2005). In this w ay, this project is also informed b y Youth
Participatory Action R esearch or YP AR (Cammarota & Fine, 2008). YP AR
combines pedagogy , research, and y outh dev elopment to engage y oung
people in learning about and addressing problems that impact their liv es.
Whereas YP AR has mostly emplo yed social science methods, YPS combines
the participatory elements of YP AR with the natur al sciences methods of
citizen science.
Substantial  Demands  on Teachers & Re-imagining Pedagogical
Content Knowledge
Whereas the vision laid out b y the NRC Fr amework and NGS S is bold and the
concept of YPS is promising as a means for achieving that vision,
transforming science education in such a dr amatic manor implies substantial
demands on teachers. The science education research communit y has begun
to tak e on the task of supporting and advising teachers. The white papers on
NGSS issued b y NARST , a worldwide organization for impro ving science
teaching through research, pro vide sev eral examples (L ynch & Bry an, 2014).
Another example comes from Kr ajcik and colleagues (2014) who proposed a
ten-step process for planning to “scaffold the dev elopment of the [NGS S
performance expectations]” (p . 162). Step nine in this process suggests that
teachers, “carefully construct a storyline to help learners build sophisticated
ideas from prior ideas using evidence that builds to the understanding
described in the PEs (p . 163). The process as a whole is promising for
supporting teachers as they bundle NGS S performance expectations (PEs),
work to understand their nuances and relationships, and then construct
“lesson lev el” versions of the PEs. Howev er, engaging with authentic
scientific problems in communit y contexts is sufficiently unpredictable to
make “carefully construct[ing] a storyline” unachiev able. In fact, the
demands on teachers to be responsiv e to who their students are and to how
science is useful in communities requires a different set of knowledge than
they ha ve traditionally been expected to build. More accur ately, science
teachers must adopt a different stance tow ards content knowledge and their
own learning. Thus, this project will empirically re-examine the concept of
pedagogical content knowledge in the context of the NGS S and ev er more
diverse student populations.
            Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Shulman, 1986) describes the
unique t ype of knowledge at the intersection of pedagogy and content and
includes “the w ays of representing and formulating the subject that mak e it
comprehensible to others” and “the conceptions and preconceptions that
students of different ages and backgrounds bring with them to the learning”
(Shulman, 1986, p . 9). As YPS aims to engage div erse students with
authentic scientific problems, both components of pedagogical content
knowledge are more complex. R esearch has shown that the scientific
knowledge required to address S SI in a local context, or “need-to-know
science, ” often does not o verlap directly with the canonical science t ypically
included in school curricula (Aik enhead, 2006). As science teachers learn
this “need-to-know science” to prepare for instruction, their pedagogical
content knowledge is lik ely to be further challenged b y the 3-dimensional
design of the NGS S.Drawing on students’ funds of knowledge is an important pr actice in
educating students, especially those from non-dominant cultur al
backgrounds (NRC, 2012; Calabrese Barton & T an, 2009). This extends
Shulman’ s emphasis on “the conceptions…that students of different…
backgrounds bring with them” (p . 9) bey ond prior school knowledge to also
consider the knowledge that resides in students’ homes and families.
Engaging div erse students with authentic scientific in vestigations in the
communit y requires that teachers learn additional scientific content (need-
to-know science) and dev elop str ategies for dr awing on students’ funds of
knowledge. As these two additional forms of knowledge intersect with the
pedagogical demands of the NGS S, we are challenged to reconsider
pedagogical content knowledge for the 21  century project of teaching 3-
dimensional science in increasingly div erse U .S. schools. This project will
address the challenge of reimagining pedagogical content knowledge b y
leveraging partnerships to support synergistic learning between teachers,
students, communities, and scientists. This project will study this learning,
with a focus on teachers’ learning, dev elopment, and pr actices.

 Research Activities and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
Research activities in volve documenting and examining the partnering,
planning, teaching, and learning of YPS projects through two means of data
collection: (1) collecting artifacts of the normal planning, teaching, and
learning process only from participants who ha ve consented to participate in
the research and (2) conducting interviews with a select group of teachers
and students who ha ve also consented to an interview . Research activities,
including data collection, will a void disruption of the normal activities of
teaching and learning and will be conducted b y UIC personnel. An y
involvement of CPS staff or students in interviews will occur outside of
school time. 
The project w as originally divided into two phases, which repeated once per
year for two and a half y ears before being interrupted b y the pandemic.
Phase I of the project are planning institutes at UIC where scientists and
science educators from UIC, Lo yola Univ ersity, and North western univ ersity
work with in vited communit y members and teachers to plan for Y outh
Participatory Science projects. Phase II of the project is facilitating and
studying the implementation of the projects planned in Phase I. Phase I
serves as professional dev elopment for teachers and occurs during breaks in
the CPS calendar (winter or summer break). Phase II consists of the
classroom implementation of the YPS projects planned in Phase I.  
Teachers who participate in the Phase I planning institute will be giv en the
opportunit y to consent to participate in the research activities of this project.
The UIC IRB has gr anted a w aiver of informed consent for the recruitment of
participating teachers from UIC progr ammatic databases. T eacher
participation will include the collection of artifacts during the planning
institute, including planning documents, written reflections, and video
recordings of the institute. They will also be giv en the opportunit y to consent
to an interview during phase I. All of the tasks completed during phase I
have the primary purpose of instructional planning and teacher learning,
with the only ex ception being the teacher interviews, which are conducted
solely for research purposes. An ethnogr aphic, semi-structured approach will
be used in interviews. A protocol is included in the appendix. It has been
developed to tr ack teacher learning in multiple realms (science content,
communit y knowledge, including sociocultur al factors) and has been
appro ved by the UIC IRB .
In Phase II, participating teachers will decide which of their class(es) will
engage in YPS projects. The PI or other UIC research personnel will visit
classes engaged in YPS to explain the study and recruit students in
participating classes using a short script, parent letter , and informed consent
documents and student assent documents appro ved by the UIC IRB . There
are parental informed consent documents for students under the age of 18
available in English and Spanish. There are also student assent documents
for students under 18 and separ ate informed consent documents forstudents 18 or older . There will be no data collected during this initial
contact and disruption of class time will be minimiz ed. Students will return
completed consent and assent forms in a sealed en velope (pro vided b y the
PI) to a manila en velope in the classroom, where they will be retriev ed by
the PI.
During phase II, teachers will be ask ed to continue written reflections with
an emphasis on capturing teachers’ science content questions and
revelations. These reflections will be done outside of class time as part of
ongoing teacher professional dev elopment. T eachers will upload these
reflections to the UIC Blackboard course management system. As part of
teacher professional dev elopment, instruction related to YPS projects will be
video recorded b y UIC personnel. In the case that these videos will be used
as research data, the faces of students who ha ve not consented to
participate will be blurred and their v erbal contributions will not be included
in transcripts. Class work artifacts from students who ha ve consented to
participate will be collected b y UIC research personnel and immediately
coded to remo ve identifiers.
Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with teachers and selected
students who ha ve consented to an interview after the YPS projects are
implemented each y ear. All of the tasks completed during Phase II are
normal educational activities, with the only ex ception being the interviews,
which are conducted solely for research purposes. An ethnogr aphic, semi-
structured approach will be used in interviews. Interview protocols for
students and teachers are included in the appendix. They been dev eloped to
track teacher and student learning in multiple realms (science content,
communit y knowledge, including sociocultur al factors) and ha ve been
appro ved by the UIC IRB . In the case that student demogr aphic or
assessment data becomes relev ant to one of the case studies, this request
will be made through centr al office for class-lev el de-identified data and/or
student lev el data for those who ha ve been properly consented in
accordance with CPS guidelines.
All data will be stored as hard copies in lock ed file cabinets or as digital
copies on encrypted stor age devices in lock ed offices at UIC. All data will be
coded with pseudon yms to remo ve identifiers as soon as it is collected. The
master list of pseudon yms will be stored b y the PI in a separ ate secure
location and destro yed upon completion of the project. Video recordings will
be edited to blur or co ver the faces of non-participants and non-participants’
verbal contributions will not be included in tr anscripts for analysis. A udio and
video recordings will be destro yed upon completion of the project.
Identifiable data will be destro yed upon request if a participant withdr aws
from the study or a portion of the study .","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
The study will use a multiple case study design. The network of
collabor ations created b y the larger efforts to support YPS represents what
case study methodologist Stak e (2006) calls the “quintain” or the collection
of cases. Each teacher -university-communit y partnership represents an
individual case. This design maximiz es our abilit y to attend to the
particularities of each case while also addressing the gener alities implied in
our questions. Our multiple case study design allows for both liter al and
theoretical replication (Yin, 2009) as we examine clusters of cases, including
teachers of v arious lev els of experience and prepar ation, three different
university partners and particular communit y and en vironmental contexts.
The multiple case study design includes plans to collect a wide arr ay of data
from different sources. The “unique strength” of a case study methodology
“is its abilit y to deal with a full v ariety of evidence – documents, artifacts,
interviews, and observ ations” (Yin, 2009, p . 11). Some of these sources of
data relate to the quintain as a whole whereas others are case specific.

and implications of the project.
Prior research on the predictors of college success shows that students are most lik ely to succeed
when they enroll in the most selectiv e institution to which they are admitted based on their
academic record. More than half of Chicago Public School (CPS) gr aduates do not adhere to this
guidance, whether due to concerns about r apidly increasing costs of attending college or the desire
to attend an institution that is a better social fit for them. The Inclusiv e Econom y Lab is partnering
with the Office of School Counseling and P ostsecondary Advising (OSCP A) at CPS to bring together
rigorous quantitativ e analysis and student perspectiv es to better understand the reasons wh y CPS
graduates choose to enroll in a specific college, with a focus on the role that financial aid pla ys in
this decision.
This study in volves an enrollment trend analysis for CPS seniors in SY18, SY19, SY20, SY21, and
SY22. The SY22 analyses do not seek RRB appro val the financial aid a ward letters data were
collected b y CPS and are part of the student record. Additionally , the data for these analyses do
not in volve any inter action between researchers and participants. Howev er, we seek RRB appro val
for the purposes of pro viding office hours to the schools in which we plan to collect financial aid
award letters from.
In SY22, we propose offering office hours at each of the high schools r andomly selected for the
data collection of financial aid a ward letters and the fiv e Crown Catalyst Gr ant high schools. The
purpose of the office hours will be to help students access their univ ersity portals and download
their a ward letters and will in volve direct contact with students who tak e part in the office hours. In
coordination with school counselors, office hours will be held virtually via Google Meet. A Google
Meet link will be shared with counselors at each school, and pending school counselor a vailabilit y
and student capacit y, office hours ma y vary in time and dur ation at each school.
We seek RRB appro val for collecting primary data that will capture information not included in the
administr ative data. The research activities we propose will allow us to understand from the
student and counselor perspectiv es what factors are most influential in students’ college-going
decisions. W e are especially interested in learning how students think about social fit and financial
factors when weighing their college options.
In SY22, we propose conducting focus groups with gr aduating high school seniors to gain insight
into what factors students consider when deciding whether or where to enroll in college. The focus
groups will be held at the same schools r andomly selected for the data collection of the full set of
award letters. A t this present time, we plan on conducting focus groups virtually via Google Meet.
Per CPS’ requirements, a CPS staff member will host the meeting and be present for the full
duration of the focus group . Co-Principal In vestigator Shantá R obinson will facilitate the focus
groups. Inclusiv e Econom y Lab staff with appro ved background checks will also be in attendance to
help moder ate the discussion. P articipants for the focus groups will be recruited at the school lev el
in coordination with the school counselor .
In SY22, we will also conduct virtual interviews with CPS counselors about their counseling
practices and how they guide students through the college application process. Counselors from
each of the 18 schools will be in vited to the interviews. Interviews will be held on Z oom and will
last appro ximately sixt y minutes. These interviews will also be recorded and tr anscribed.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
Research Question 1:  How do the siz e and composition of financial aid a wards affect students’
decisions about whether or where to enroll in college?
Context: From previous analyses of students’ Senior Exit Questionnaire (SEQ) responses, we ha ve
learned that financial factors such as total cost and financial aid a ward package are extremely
influential in students’ decisions about whether or where to enroll in college. Among SEQ
respondents in the class of 2018, total cost  and financial aid package  consistently r ank among
the most influential factors in college choice. Similarly , 53 percent and 55 percent of respondents
indicated that receipt or non-receipt of a scholarship for attending college would hea vily influence
their decision about whether to enroll in college or which college to enroll in. T o further explore this
phenomenon, we conducted a net -price analysis with data from 62 students in the district and
determined that students, on a verage, tend to enroll in colleges where they do not ha ve to pa y for
tuition and ev en receiv e additional money through financial aid to assist with other costs such as
room and board, or associated fees.
While these findings ma y be indicativ e that students’ decisions are driv en in large part b y finances,
our sample of 62 students is too small to dr aw any substantiv e gener alizations from the analysis.
As such, we would lik e to collect additional— and more gr anular —data from a larger sample of
students to understand how stick er price and financial aid ma y affect students’ decisions about
whether or where to apply to college. Moreo ver, we would also lik e to explore how the siz e and
components of financial aid (e.g. , grant aid vs. loan offers) might also affect students’ decisions
about whether to enroll in a specific college.
Hypothesis: We hypothesiz e that students receiving more financial aid and more gr ant aid (as
opposed to loans) will be more lik ely to enroll in match colleges.
 
Research Question 2: What are the implications of total cost and financial aid for college
persistence/retention?
Context:  Through con versations with counselors and administr ation in OSCP A, we ha ve heard that
students who ma y choose to attend a more expensiv e school sometimes end up tr ansferring or
dropping out altogether because of an inabilit y to pa y tuition and other associated costs of
attendance. W e’ve heard similar anecdotes from some of our college partners sa ying that it ’s very
common for students to lea ve the univ ersity during or after the first term. As such, we would be
interested in seeing how college price and financial aid ma y affect students’ willingness to persist
at their selected univ ersities or persist in their studies at an y college. In order to measure
persistence and retention, we will use NSC data and look at first -to second term persistence and
retention and fall-to-fall persistence and retention for all students for whom we ha ve financial aid
information.
Hypothesis: After matriculation, we h ypothesiz e that students with a lower net cost of attendance
will be more lik ely to remain at that college than their peers attending colleges with a larger net
price of attendance. Similarly , we h ypothesiz e that students with a lower net price of attendance
will be more lik ely to persist in an y college at all compared to their peers at colleges with a higher
net price of attendance.
 
Research Question 3: Which social factors are students most considering when deciding whether
or where to enroll?
Context:  While match has long been a focus of the district, we understand that students are also
considering other factors in their college decisions such as social fit. Some examples of social fit
factors include pro ximity to home, preference for attending an institution with r acial
representation, athletic in volvement/recruitment, and presence of a particular academic progr am
that appealed to students’ academic goals. Whatev er the reason, social fit seems to hea vily
influence students’ decisions about where to enroll in college and these factors are not currently
accounted for in the academic match fr amework but can ha ve lasting implications for college
success. As such, we would lik e to conduct a series of focus groups and interviews with both
counselors and students to understand which factors are most influencing students’ decisions about
where to enroll in college and the insights that counselors ha ve learned from their students that
have informed their advising tactics.Hypothesis: We hypothesiz e that students with close familial ties and/or obligations ma y be more
likely to undermatch at colleges closer to them.
 
Research Question 4:  How might attending a college that is considered a social fit affect college
persistence?
Context: The liter ature on fit shows that students are more lik ely to engage in their coursework
and activities on campus when they feel they belong and their opinions are v alued. This can be
integr al to student dev elopment and academic performance as students are more inclined to
engage with their peers and professors when needing assistance on coursework.
Hypothesis: We hypothesiz e that students attending colleges with more of the amenities,
services, and supports that they prefer , will persist in college at higher r ates than those who attend
a college that ma y not be the best social fit for them.
 
Research Question 5: How has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the choices students are
making?
Context: The pandemic broadly disrupted students’ postsecondary plans. National research shows
that applications to and enrollment in postsecondary institutions ha ve declined, with larger declines
for students of color and for those attending communit y colleges. Student focus groups during
SY22 will lend insight into how o ver a y ear of remote learning during high school has impacted
student decisions on whether or where to go to college. 
Hypothesis: We hypothesiz e that the pandemic has and will continue to impact students b y
increasing the number of students choosing to not enroll in college and enrolling in an academic
undermatch institution. W e anticipate students sharing about familial financial constr aints and a
desire to remain in close pro ximity to family as factors that influence their college decision-making.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject. What is the
contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build upon the body of extant
knowledge?
This work aims to unco ver some of the driving forces of undermatch among CPS students to better
understand how to tailor supports to students in the district. Through our research-pr actice
partnership with the Office of School Counseling and P ostsecondary Advising, we can inform
counselors on the ground of the high-lev el trends that we can observ e in the data. W e can also
help co-create materials to help students choose schools that suit their academic needs, meet their
financial capabilities, and pro vide additional social supports necessary for college persistence and
completion.
Increasing educational attainment among individuals from low -income backgrounds is perhaps the
most important a venue through which to impro ve upw ard mobilit y in the United States. Individuals
with some college or an associate degree earn appro ximately 14 percent more than those with only
a high school diploma. Furthermore, individuals with a bachelor ’s degree earn appro ximately 65
percent more than those with only a high school diploma (U .S. Department of Labor , 2015).
Howev er, enormous disparities exist in educational attainment between students from low -income
backgrounds and their wealthier peers. According to a 2016 study b y the P ell Institute, just 15
percent of students from the bottom socioeconomic quartile earn a bachelor ’s degree within eight
years of gr aduating high school, compared with 60 percent of students from the top quartile.
Additionally , their study showed that 69 percent of students who are enrolled in the most selectiv e
universities come from the top socioeconomic quartile, compared with just four percent from the
bottom quartile (The P ell Institute, 2016).
Some of the sources of inequit y in educational attainment can be found in students’ college
selection process, and more specifically in “college match” and “college fit. ” Evidence suggests that
students from low -income backgrounds ha ve a propensit y to choose postsecondary institutions
that they are o verqualified to attend (i.e. , academic undermatching), which ma y impact their
engagement in their studies and can ha ve implications for their lik elihood of college completion
(Roderick, Coca, and Nagaoka, 2011). Similarly , if a student attends a college that does not fit with
their desired en vironment, it ma y have negativ e implications for their college experience, mental
health, and college retention and completion (Gilbreath, Kim, and Nichols, 2011; P ascarella and
Terenzini, 1983).

Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities associated with this
study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as possible, all that will be asked of your
research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, etc.)
We seek appro val from the RRB for two research activities that in volve qualitativ e data collection
from students and counselors to better understand the college decision-making process.
In SY22, we will work in partnership with school counselors to design a data collection system that
is minimally burdensome for staff and students. Before collecting aid letters, we will obtain student
consent/assent and parental consent if required. Students who submit all their aid letters will ha ve
a chance to win a $50 e-gift card in a schoolwide r affle, with one winner per school.
We also propose conducting focus groups and interviews to gain a better understanding of what is
not captured in administr ative data, specifically how finances and student perceptions of social fit
play a role in college choices and success. In the Spring of 2022, we plan to hold focus groups with
graduating high school seniors from CPS to gain insight into the factors that influence their decision
to enroll in college.
Focus groups of 6-9 students will be held at schools r andomly selected. Counselors will support
recruitment efforts b y sending out recruitment emails to students. P articipation is v oluntary , and
the email will mak e it clear that it has no impact on eligibilit y for an y future progr ams or services.
Interested students will complete an online interest form, and those o ver 18 will proceed to a
consent form where they will be briefed on the research purposes, risks, and their rights as
participants. F or students under 18, we will email parents a consent form that will require their
signature before participation. All participants under 18 will also sign an assent form.
The focus groups will be conducted virtually via Google Meet, and a CPS staff member will host the
meeting, as required b y CPS . To capture all contributions, each session will be video recorded, and
students will be reminded of this at the beginning. They ma y leave their camer a off or use a virtual
background. P articipation is v oluntary , and students do not ha ve to answer an y questions they do
not wish to answer . A member of the research team and staff from the Inclusiv e Econom y Lab will
be present to moder ate the discussion.
Each focus group will last 90 minutes, and all participants will receiv e a $30 e-gift card regardless
of how much they contribute or whether they sta y for the entire session. R ecordings will be sa ved
to a restricted- access UChicago Hopper folder and will be deleted no later than fiv e years after the
end of the study .
In addition to focus groups with students, we will also be conducting virtual interviews with CPS
counselors in the spring of 2022. These interviews will focus on the counselors' pr actices and their
guidance of students through the college application process. W e will be conducting one-on-one
interviews with each counselor to ensure confidentialit y and anon ymity for participants.
Participation in the interviews is completely v oluntary and will not impact participants'
emplo yment. Counselors from each school in the study will be in vited to participate through an
email and will ha ve to click on a consent link to complete the necessary form. P articipants will be
briefed on the research purposes, the v oluntary nature of participation, the risks associated, and
their rights as research participants.
The interviews will be scheduled using Z oom and will be recorded as an audio-only file for
transcription purposes. P articipants will be reminded of the recording at the beginning of the
interview , and they will be encour aged to use their first name only or a pseudon ym if they prefer .
Qualitativ e data analysis will tak e place in the Inclusiv e Econom y Lab . Participation will in volve a
60-minute interview and a $30 e-gift card, and all participants will receiv e the full compensation
regardless of their responses or abilit y to sta y for the full dur ation.","and Analytical Technique

subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
This quantitativ e, correlational case study research (Fr aenkel & W allen,
2009) analyz es the intent to use a dedicated mak erspace for facult y
members of a high-po verty, urban high school in the Midwestern United
States: Schurz High School. The school is equipped with a U .S. Department
of Education-funded dedicated mak erspace. It has student demogr aphics
representing groups the National Science Board (2021) identifies as
underperforming in STEM subject areas: minorit y and low -income students.
Early research on mak erspaces as an inno vation to classroom instruction
suggests impro ved learning outcomes in STEM subject areas (Barnett, 2005;
Kafai et al. , 2014; P eppler & Glosson, 2013; Sheridan et al. , 2014). It is
essential to examine how teachers integr ate technologies because, as
Ertmer (2005) noted, “the decision regarding whether and how to use
technology for instruction rests on the shoulders of classroom teachers” (p .
27).
    Data from multiple go vernment agencies, think tanks, and testing
organizations showed U .S. students lagging their counterparts in STEM
learning achiev ement, no significant impro vement in test scores in STEM
subjects in the past decade, a STEM learning gap for minorit y groups and
women, and a lack of prepar ation and interest in pursuing STEM at the post -
secondary lev el. As a result, this learning problem negativ ely affects a.)
individuals because they are not able to obtain STEM jobs that pa y more,
have less unemplo yment, and ha ve long-term growth prospects, b .) the
national econom y because STEM careers in the United States driv e
innovation and fend off global competition, c.) national securit y because the
military is reliant on a STEM-skilled labor force to update defense
technologies and handle complex systems. P ossible pedagogical solutions to
impro ve K-12 STEM learning outcomes included approaching STEM education
from a constructivist perspectiv e that requires activ e engagement from
students, incorpor ating multiple disciplines in STEM learning activities,
personalization, lev eraging the power of technology tools, using projects as
vehicles for STEM engagement, and putting the student at the center of the
learning process.
The liter ature review rev eals a K -12 STEM learning deficit in the United
States and that mak erspaces can potentially increase STEM learning
outcomes for students. As a recent trend, it is still being determined how
makerspaces are being incorpor ated b y K-12 teachers into the curriculum.

school in the Midwestern United States and their experience with adopting a
makerspace into their instructional pr actice using the UT AUT model of
technology acceptance and use.","and Student/Staff Involvement

subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
A key issue with servicing gifted students lies in how giftedness is defined
and the subjectiv e interpretations of how to best support gifted students.
The U .S. Department of Education defined giftedness in the Elementary and
Secondary Act of 2002 as y outh that demonstr ate high abilit y intellectually ,
creativ ely, artistically , or in specific content areas (Elementary and
Secondary Act of 2002). When teachers were ask ed about their definition of
giftedness, studies found that the idea of a giftedness were based on
teachers’ personal and cultur al experience perception of critical and creativ e
thinkers (Mun, et al. , 2020). The subjectiv e nature of the national definition
of gifted students created a dynamic that led to school districts and teachers
defining giftedness and servicing their needs differently within school
districts, states, and nationally .
As the con versation of equit y increased nationally , the policies around
identif ying gifted students changed to reflect the div erse student population
within div erse K -12 school districts. The “Ev ery Student Succeeds Act ”
(ESSA) introduced a form of accountabilit y to identif y diverse gifted students
by mandating state plans be inclusiv e to multiple groups of students,
including gifted students, to receiv e Title II funding (K aul and Da vis, 2018).
The gifted identification gap is progressiv ely narrowing due to the state
plans, but there is a growing achiev ement gap amongst gifted learners.
 Kaul and Da vis (2018) researched the state plans to understand how states
expect to be inclusiv e to div erse gifted students. K aul and Da vis (2018)
found that most states addressed the concern of equitable identification, but
only 16 of the 52 plans explicitly discussed the services and professional
development for teachers to school districts to implement comprehensiv e
gifted progr ams.
The reviews from v arious t ypes of liter ature suggest that gifted services are
a significant factor that impacts the ex cellence gap amongst gifted students,
and that services differ based on the socioeconomic status of the school,
teacher perceptions, and cultur al and linguistic differences. The liter ature
further explores the history of the achiev ement gap amongst gifted students
and the v arious factors that affect their access to effectiv e individual
support. R ambo-Hernandez, P eters, and Pluck ers (2019) research defines
the achiev ement gap as an ""ex cellence gap"", which refers to the difference
of academic performance amongst 90  percentile subgroup . They also
researched the conceptual and educational issues that impacted schools and
found that low -income schools had limited resources to support a rigorous
and acceler ated curriculum. The factors of resources that were listed in the
research included tr ansportation, technology , and certified educators or
professional dev elopment opportunities (Pluck er and P eters, 2017). The
advanced opportunities are limited within low -income schools based on the
lack of resources in the school to support the acceler ation progr am.
Overall, the research studies found that the ex cellence gap amongst gifted
students reflects the o verall achiev ement gap amongst students in affluentthand underserv ed areas. The further implications into closing the ex cellence
gap is how to dev elop an interv ention model that is comprehensiv e for
students in an y demogr aphic.
This study builds upon the need to pro vide recommendations of interv ention
models that are comprehensiv e for div erse gifted students in order to
narrow the achiev ement gap amongst gifted students in our communities.","and Student/Staff Involvement

Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific
analytical techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
This study will use a case study design to explore the factors affecting the
under achiev ement of gifted 3rd gr ade students in ELA at Andrew Carnegie
Elementary School. The case study approach allows for in-depth explor ation
of the context, instructional str ategies, and challenges experienced b y this
specific group of students.
For quantitativ e data collection and analysis, the data that will be collected
will be the 3rd-5th gr ade ELA IAR data from SY2021-22, SY2022-23,
SY2023-24. The documents will be analyz ed, and patterns will be recorded
and con verted into a frequency chart to show the growth of gifted students
ELA scores o ver time. The frequency chart will be presented in the form of a
bar chart showing the ELA lev els of gifted students o ver time in order to
identif y a trend amongst under achieving gifted students in v arious gr ade
levels.
For qualitativ e data collection and analysis, the data that will be collected
will be the semi-structured interviews conducted with teachers to gain
insight into their perceptions of the challenges faced b y gifted students in
ELA. The interview questions will explore factors such as instructional
practices, student motiv ation, and a vailable resources. Additionally ,
classroom observ ations will be carried out to gather data on the instructional
strategies used with gifted students in ELA. These observ ations will focus on
engagement, differentiated instruction, and the implementation of
interv entions aimed at supporting gifted learners. The data from interviews
and observ ations will be analyz ed using thematic analysis. This approach will
help identif y recurring patterns and themes related to the challenges and
supports experienced b y gifted students in ELA. Coding and categorization of
responses will allow for the identification of k ey factors contributing to low
achiev ement."

aims to share adv anced w ater qualit y testing techniques with chemistry
and/or biology high school students in Chicago . All activities will be done
under the direction and supervision of chemistry and/or biology teachers.","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this
subject. What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this
research build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Urbanization, climate change, and infr astructure mismanagement are r apidly
exacerbating str ains on storm water infr astructure [1], [2], [3] . Storm water
management in urban areas is particularly complex due to the dev elopment
of impervious land surfaces, man y sources of w ater qualit y impairment, and
concerns about en vironmental justice [3], [4], [5] . Inadequate storm water
infrastructure can lead to urban flooding, which induces negativ e physical
and non-ph ysical impacts and other socioeconomic r amifications [6].
Uncontrolled pollution in storm water runoff from urban areas represents an
important public health concern [7], [8], [9] . Impro ved storm water
management in urban areas requires detailed observ ations of w ater lev els,
discharge r ates in streams and storm sewers, and w ater qualit y parameters
[6], [10], [11] . 
Flood prediction and storm water management requires h ydrological models
to simulate the mo vement of w ater from precipitation into streams through
hydrological processes under v arious control and land management
scenarios. While ph ysically -based theories ha ve been dev eloped for
characterization of individual processes, h ydrologic modeling remains
inherently data-driv en, relying on measurements of precipitation, discharge,
land usage, w ater usage, and h ydrogr aphy that v ary significantly throughout
a watershed. Figure 2 shows h ydrological processes simulated with
watershed models, including precipitation, streamflow , infiltr ation,
evapotranspir ation, soil w ater mo vement, etc. Flood susceptibilit y studies in
the Midwest, and nationally , have traditionally been undertak en and
communicated on a w atershed basis and ha ve been primarily focused on
riverine or fluvial flooding. While these assessments are vital to adaptation
to changes in precipitation and surface and sub-surface h ydrology in the
region, they are not sufficient for understanding local-scale flooding,
particularly urban or pluvial flooding.
One approach for more robust storm water data collection and
characterization is through citiz en science [6], [11], [12] . Researchers
typically monitor w ater qualit y at select locations or in major riv er systems
but lack sufficient resources to tr ack w ater qualit y in ev ery stream
throughout a w atershed. Emplo ying v olunteer citiz en scientists is a
potentially important approach to monitor flooding and w ater qualit y in
urban areas [6]. Citiz en scientists can meaningfully contribute b y collecting
samples from nearb y streams and lak es, identif ying potential sources of
pollution in local w atersheds, and increasing the amount of w ater qualit y
data that are a vailable. An organiz ed network of citiz en scientists could
potentially monitor a whole w atershed or the storm infr astructure of a cit y.
Citizen science not only increases spatial and tempor al data quantit y but
also helps achiev e public outreach b y gener ating communit y awareness and
increasing scientific liter acy [13], [14] .

While digital data pro vides man y potential opportunities for observing

water for coliform bacteria, whereas testing for all possible disease-causing
organisms is a complex task. In addition to coliform testing, we will teach
citizen scientists to test w ater for pH (a measure of acidit y), turbidit y (a
measure of light scatter indicativ e of particles), and conductivit y (a measure
of the presence of salts in w ater). Green infr astructure should help alleviate
non-point sources of pollution such as animal w aste, road salts, and
particulate matter released during storm ev ents. The citiz en science

What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research
build upon the body of extant knowledge?
In order to help children learn about priv acy and securit y in w ays that will help
them to be prepared to face
the m yriad risks inherent in their online experiences, we need a deeper
understanding of children’ s
interactions within and across their da y-to-da y experiences—their learning
ecologies [4,5]. W e particularly
need to understand how we can lev erage a learning ecologies perspectiv e to
promote their cybersecurit y
learning across the two contexts where they spend the majorit y of their time,
home and school. T o do this,
we dev elop and dr aw upon a new approach—integr ating ecological systems
theory [4,5] with priv acy and
securit y to dev elop the Connecting Contexts Fr amework for Priv acy and Securit y
Learning (hereafter
“Connecting Contexts”). This fr amework will establish methods for dev eloping
tools and resources targeted
toward different stak eholders important in a child’ s learning, including parents,
teachers, and children
themselv es. Applying this fr amework will gener ate curriculum for students,
training for parents, and
professional dev elopment for teachers. Curriculum and related educational
materials will be tailored
across three gr ade bands (K -1, 2-3, 4-5) so students will dev elop and expand
their understanding of the
following four core concepts throughout elementary school: how the Internet
works (Internet), digital
privacy (Priv acy), cybersecurit y (Securit y), and being a good digital citiz en
(Digital Citiz enship). Finally ,
we will work with parents to identif y their needs to help them become partners
in the learning process.
Parent-specific resources will help scaffold parent -child con versations at home
to encour age family
conversations about digital priv acy and securit y practices in ev eryday life. T able

how educational materials will ev olve throughout elementary school.
By lev eraging children’ s learning ecologies to promote priv acy and securit y skill
development at a y ounger
age, we will help children dev elop a foundation of knowledge they can build
upon as they ha ve more online
experiences. This deeper understanding is imper ative for better equipping
children to face (and ev en avoid)
the numerous threats inherent in their online experiences. Additionally , our
Connecting Contexts fr amework
will better prepare family members, teachers, administr ators, and policymak ers
to work with (and adv ocate

During the previous y ear, we completed analysis of the four focus groups with
nine teachers from our partner school in Maryland and three focus groups with
five teachers from Murr ay Language Academ y in Chicago and published a
corresponding white paper in December 2021. W e also completed analysis of
interviews with elementary school teachers and parents of elementary students
from across the country (not with CPS specifically), and we ha ve a paper
currently in revisions detailing the findings and implications of this research.
In 2023, we plan to conduct a professional dev elopment workshop with
interested Murr ay Language Academ y teachers in early 2023 to to pilot
educational materials we co-designed in their classrooms in the spring of 2023.
We plan to organiz e formal and/or informal sessions with parents at our partner
school in Maryland and Murr ay Language Academ y in Chicago to better
understand their needs regarding digital priv acy and securit y and to dev elop
resources to help them work with their children to dev elop better securit y
hygiene.
In December 2021, F ebruary 2022, and March 2022, we piloted a priv acy and
securit y learning activit y with 21 children between the ages of 7-11 from three
different after school progr ams across the US . Additionally , we conducted two
focus groups with nine teachers from Montpelier Elementary School and
interviews with four teachers from our partner school in Chicago to understand
how we could impro ve upon and extend these activities for implementation in
elementary classroom. W e are currently finalizing a paper that presents an
analysis of data from these sessions.
In September 2022, we r an a full-da y professional dev elopment workshop with
10 elementary school teachers from our partner school in Chicago to co-design
additional priv acy and securit y education classroom learning activities and

Study Overview
Executive Summary or Abstract
Please provide a high-level overview of your study, including a summary of the
motivation, design, and implications of the project.
Children are using information and communication technologies (ICT s) such as
smartphones,
tablets, apps, and websites from a v ery young age. T o properly prepare children
with digital
privacy and securit y skills they can carry into adulthood, they need to be
equipped with these
skills from the time they first enter school. These lessons also need to be
reinforced across the
various contexts where they use technology , especially at home and school. W e
plan to dev elop
tools and resources targeted tow ard each stak eholder group , including
curriculum for students,
training for parents, and professional dev elopment and curriculum for teachers.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The k ey research questions we will answer through this project are:
RQ1 (Priv acy and Securit y Ecosystem): What factors impact how priv acy and
securit y concepts are
integr ated across home and school contexts for K -5th gr aders?
RQ2 (Design): How can micro-lessons, digital tools, and resources be designed
to help K -5 children
connect priv acy and securit y concepts across home and school contexts?
RQ3 (Learning): How are children’ s, teachers’ , and parents’ understanding of
privacy and securit y
concepts influenced b y priv acy and securit y resources integr ated across home
and school?
This is explor atory research, so we do not necessarily ha ve a hypothesisPurpose and Literature Review
Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject.
What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research
build upon the body of extant knowledge?
In order to help children learn about priv acy and securit y in w ays that will help
them to be prepared to face
the m yriad risks inherent in their online experiences, we need a deeper
understanding of children’ s
interactions within and across their da y-to-da y experiences—their learning
ecologies [4,5]. W e particularly
need to understand how we can lev erage a learning ecologies perspectiv e to
promote their cybersecurit y
learning across the two contexts where they spend the majorit y of their time,
home and school. T o do this,
we dev elop and dr aw upon a new approach—integr ating ecological systems
theory [4,5] with priv acy and
securit y to dev elop the Connecting Contexts Fr amework for Priv acy and Securit y
Learning (hereafter
“Connecting Contexts”). This fr amework will establish methods for dev eloping
tools and resources targeted
toward different stak eholders important in a child’ s learning, including parents,
teachers, and children
themselv es. Applying this fr amework will gener ate curriculum for students,
training for parents, and
professional dev elopment for teachers. Curriculum and related educational
materials will be tailored
across three gr ade bands (K -1, 2-3, 4-5) so students will dev elop and expand
their understanding of the
following four core concepts throughout elementary school: how the Internet
works (Internet), digital
privacy (Priv acy), cybersecurit y (Securit y), and being a good digital citiz en
(Digital Citiz enship). Finally ,
we will work with parents to identif y their needs to help them become partners
in the learning process.
Parent-specific resources will help scaffold parent -child con versations at home
to encour age family
conversations about digital priv acy and securit y practices in ev eryday life. T able
1 provides an o verview of
how educational materials will ev olve throughout elementary school.
By lev eraging children’ s learning ecologies to promote priv acy and securit y skill
development at a y ounger
age, we will help children dev elop a foundation of knowledge they can build
upon as they ha ve more online
experiences. This deeper understanding is imper ative for better equipping
children to face (and ev en avoid)
the numerous threats inherent in their online experiences. Additionally , our
Connecting Contexts fr amework
will better prepare family members, teachers, administr ators, and policymak ers
to work with (and adv ocate
for) y oung children to help them dev elop these skills and na vigate using them
online.

Consent
After the protocol is appro ved, we hope to ha ve the Assistant Vice Principal and
Vice Principal
of Murr ay Language Academ y help us recruit participants through the P arent
Teacher
Association. Before an y interviews or focus groups, participants will be sent a
consent form o ver
email. W e will be asking for consent for audio recording, visual recording, chat
recording, and
screenshots for teacher and parent focus groups, and co-design sessions. W e
will only plan on surv eying children if the recruited teachers are able to use our
one of our co-designed resources in a classroom period in this academic y ear
using pre and post surv eys - the teacher would administer the surv eys and also
complete a surv ey about the effectiv eness of the educational activit y. Directly
before the
interview begins, we will also ask for v erbal consent for audio , visual, and chat
recordings, and
screenshots.
Logistics
Interviews, focus groups, and co-design sessions with teachers and parents will
be held o ver the Z oom
video conferencing platform or in person as COVID-19 restrictions allow . We will
not inter act with children directly . Each focus group will ha ve a maximum of 4
participants. Each
interview and focus group will be 60-90 minutes long. Each co-design session
will be about 60
minutes long. T eachers will also be giv en a surv ey using Qualtrics to ask
background
questions. F or teachers, there will be both solo interviews with one or more
researchers present and focus groups with one or more researchers present. F or
teacher
interviews, we will divide the group b y grade band (K -1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-8). W e
hope to get up to 20
parents and 2 teachers per gr ade band for a total of up to 10 teachers.
All stak eholders in our co-design sessions will look at virtual protot ypes, and we
will use screen
annotation to see participants’ thoughts on the protot ype. W e will use
screenshots to record what
the participants dr aw. We will also record the chat to k eep tr ack of discussions.
Stakeholders will be ask ed questions about their uses technology use within
their school or
district, and how this technology crosses the home-school boundary; their
experiences with,
attitudes about, and knowledge of priv acy and securit y concepts that occur at
school v ersus at
home; and priv acy/securit y challenges and successes they perceiv e for
connecting home and
school contexts. The first set of co-design sessions will focus on contributingideas and feedback
on our latest iter ation of our priv acy and securit y resource protot ypes. In the
second set of co-
design sessions, we will work with teachers and parents to design new w ays to
integr ate
privacy and securit y concepts in the classroom, within participants’ home
contexts, and across
home and school contexts.The final part of the project is asking ~4 teachers to
evaluate the materials we design with their class in one class period during the
academic y ear with pre and post activit y surv eys.
Again, we would reiter ate, if possible, we would w ant to do the same protocol
with children if
we are able to ha ve a CPS staff member supervise these sessions. This includes
60-90 minute
focus groups with 3-5 students and 60 minute co-design sessions with 3-5
students, within the
grade bands (K -1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-8).
We are planning on communicating our findings through professional
development sessions for
teachers and in seminars for the P arents Association at Murr ay Language
Academ y. We have
already held multiple teacher dev elopment sessions, and at least one seminar
on kids and internet
safety for the P arents Association at Murr ay Language Academ y. Similarly , we
would aim to
hold professional dev elopment and parent seminars for CPS families at other
schools and con vey
these findings via presentations to district officials at CPS . We would also meet
regularly with
the Principal and Vice Principal at Murr ay Language Academ y to discuss our
findings, as well as
members of the parents association. W e would be happ y to similarly meet and
discuss the
findings with district officials to ensure our results ha ve a positiv e impact
beyond Murr ay
Language Academ y","and Analytical Technique

The findings from the Monitoring The Future study constitute a significant
contribution to the adv ancement of scientific knowledge and the formulation of
effectiv e educational and social policy . In fact, the study repeatedly has been
referred to b y the national media as one of the country's most respected and
reliable sources of information on American y oung people. The data collected b y
the study serv e as the benchmark for man y state and local surv eys of alcohol,

which y our district can be an important part, will continue to ha ve consider able
impact o ver time.
The study obtains the views of American y oung people through self -administered
surveys giv en to students in their schools, which tak e appro ximately 35-40
minutes. Each y ear since 1975, Monitoring the Future has surv eyed a nation wide
sample of high school seniors. Since 1991, the project has also included
nation wide samples of 8th and 10th gr ade students. Each school that participates
is invited to do so for two consecutiv e years. Within each school, up to 350
students are surv eyed. If an y school has more than 350 in the selected gr ade
level, we will sample from among the students (probably selecting 150 ‑  200
students). There are sev eral statistically sound means of sampling students.
The identities of participating schools and students are k ept completely

identif ying information is requested.) R esponses are reported only in a statistical
fashion that cannot identif y individual students, schools or districts. W e have
secured a Gr ant of Confidentialit y from the U .S. Department of Justice that fully
ensures our abilit y to k eep the data confidential.
The Monitoring the Future study is administered b y trained field personnel

The study focuses on students’ experiences and views about a wide r ange of
subjects of importance to the nation. The questions listed below highlight the
kinds of issues treated in this study:
Has v aping during school increased among students in recent y ears?
To what extent does substance use in adolescence cause academic
attainment?
To what extent is substance use a consequence of early educational
failures?
What are the linkages between educational experience, delinquent
behavior, and substance use, specifically v aping, tobacco , alcohol,
marijuana, and other drugs?
What are the local trends in comparison to national trends for teen
substance use and academic attitudes?","Please provide an overview of the existing research and literature on this subject.
What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research build
upon the body of extant knowledge?
The project ’s goal is to document national and regional trends in students’
behavior and attitudes, particularly those that ma y harm students ph ysically or
academically . For example, documentation b y Monitoring the Future (MTF) of the
soaring use of e-cigarettes b y U.S. schoolchildren w as featured in recent rulings
the FDA introduced to counter this trend. Although it seems they are expected to ,
schools cannot do ev erything alone. Ultimately , MTF aims to gener ate additional
attention and resources to aid schoolchildren.
MTF study , now in its 50th y ear, focuses on the views of American y outh on a
broad r ange of nationally important issues, including their health and safet y,
education and work plans, alcohol and drug use, and attitudes tow ard major
institutions. The study also monitors national and regional trends in beha viors
and attitudes that are particularly harmful, both ph ysically and academically , such
as alcohol and drug use. The findings from this study constitute a significant
contribution to the adv ancement of scientific knowledge and the formulation of
effectiv e educational and social policy . In fact, the study repeatedly has been
referred to b y the national media as one of the country's most respected and
reliable sources of information on American y oung people. MTF measures
progress on sev eral national goals, including those listed in the U .S. Department
of Health and Human Services
Health y People 2030. The data collected b y the study serv e as the benchmark for
many state and local surv eys of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs.
MTF pro vides important research on emerging tobacco products, lik e e-cigarettes
and v aping, for the FDA to impro ve the public health. W e believ e that the findings
from this study , directly reported to v arious policy -making agencies and
disseminated through the media, can constitute a significant contribution to the
advancement of scientific knowledge, the formulation of effectiv e education, and
social policy . We continue to find a great deal of enthusiasm and interest in
this study among policy mak ers at all lev els of go vernment, leading educators,
researchers, and the national media. The study is funded b y the National
Institutes of Health of the U .S. Department of Health and Human Services,
(grant# DA001411).","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
MTF is a major measure used to determine if schools are safe, disciplined,
alcohol- and drug-free. There are no questions about sex, abortion or sensitiv e
parental beha viors. MTF is the benchmark study for most other studies on
alcohol, tobacco , and other drug use. The MTF study is also flexible and can be fit
into odd schedule blocks if necessary .
The study obtains the views of American y oung people through self -administered
surveys giv en to students in their schools. Y ou will note that the attached surv eys
have multiple forms. The v ariation in the surv eys permits us to gather a great
deal of information and y et limit the time it tak es individual students to fill them
out to 35-40 minutes. While all of these forms will be used at each school, an y
individual student will fill out only one form. Surv eys are r andomly assigned.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
MTF utiliz es a repeated series of self -administered surv eys giv en to students in
their schools in which the same segments of the population (8th, 10th, and 12th
graders) are presented with the same set of questions o ver a period of y ears to
see how answers change o ver time. Exiting and entering schools are staggered so
that ev ery year half the schools ha ve been in the study for two y ears and the
other half has been in the study for one y ear. This design increases the stabilit y of
the estimates, and allows us to examine whether the estimates observ ed overall
are robust and replicated in the half sample of continuing schools.
Because of the v aried nature of the research products resulting from the study ,
the statistical analysis procedures r ange from cross tabulations to regression
analysis to hier archical linear modeling and latent growth curv e modeling. W e will
continue to conduct man y of the same sorts of analyses -- such as regression
analysis, multiple classification analysis, and structur al equation modeling -- that
for more than four decades, we ha ve successfully used to examine the
epidemiology and historical trends in student attitudes and beha viors, such as
substance use. W e will also continue to adopt new analytic str ategies to address
other specific aims."

SHE/PHS PD F ollow-Up Interviews
Key informant interviews will be held with 12-24 CPS Sexual Health
Education/P ersonal Health and Safet y instructors that teach elementary , middle,
and high school students. Interviews will be conducted on a rolling basis
throughout the SY24-25, after SHE/PHS Instructors finish implementing
SHE/PHS lessons. Each k ey informant interview will tak e place virtually o ver
Zoom using UIC’ s platform and will last 45-60 minutes. Interviews will tak e
place at a time that is most con venient for participant, so that it will not conflict
with their work responsibilities. Instructors will be ask ed about their opinions
and feedback on the SHE/PHS instructor tr aining, how they implemented the
SHE/PHS curriculum in the school, how the tr aining prepared them to implement
SHE/PHS , and what changes and additions to existing resources would help
support their deliv ery of the SHE/PHS curriculum. A cop y of the interview
questions that will be ask ed during the k ey informant interview is attached to
this application. Please see “Impro ving Ad Hlth_SHE PD Flwup Interview
Guide_v1_03Oct24.docx” attached to this application.
All notes and recordings obtained during the interviews will be stored on
password-protected computers and will be only accessible to UIC staff that are
assigned to this project. P articipants’ names will not be on the interview notes or
voice files. Individual staff members and schools will not be identified or named
in verbal and written reports for CPS , and school staff members will be referred
to or described in the reports using gener al role descriptions, such as school

publications or presentations, but interviewees’ names will not be used within
these manuscripts or presentations.
These procedures are described in the informed consent documents that are
provided to interviewees prior to interviews. Informed consent documents will be
reviewed with all interviewees before they consent to participate in the
interview . During interviews, participants will be ask ed not to mention names of
students and other staff members during the interview . Howev er, if they are
accidentally mentioned during the interview , the names will be redacted from
written tr anscripts. P articipants ma y choose to participate in interviews, but not
have the interview recorded. P articipants will be ask ed to consent to participate
in the interview and be recorded during the interview during the informed

Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has entered into a cooper ate agreement with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention, Department of Adolescent and
School Health (CDC -DASH), with the Univ ersity of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)
serving as the designated ev aluator . This work, which w as determined to be
non-research, continues to build upon a previous cooper ative agreement ( 2021-
1532-CPS ). The ev aluation team at UIC is pro viding CPS the ev aluation support
through tr acking and reporting of performance and processes indicators that are
required b y CDC -DASH. In addition, the ev aluation team will assess progr am
qualit y, effectiv eness, and sustainabilit y. This will be achiev ed through activities
such as tr aining and technique assistance, identif ying capacit y building
opportunities for k ey stak eholders including CPS teachers, principals, and other
support staff . Data collection efforts will also include interviews with CPS staff ,
focus group with students in the k ey initiativ e progr ams, and identif ying
knowledge gains or gaps through pre/post/follow -up ev aluations of professional
development workshops.  The findings will pro vide v aluable insights to gr antees
and pr actitioners, and be shared with CDC -DASH. The results ma y be
disseminated through publications, and conference presentations as ev aluation
findings and lessons learned.","Please list all research questions and hypotheses associated with this project.
The ev aluation plan co-dev eloped between the P3RC and OSHW aligns with CDC
grant requirements and outlines the methods for collecting performance and
process measures data directly from schools through electronic surv eys, in-
person meetings, technical assistance requests, and on-site observ ation b y CPS
staff members.  The CDC mandates the following ev aluation questions, in which
the role of the ev aluation team is simply to pro vide advice and technical
support. 
 
1.Health Education
a.To what extent do recipients support schools to implement qualit y health
education?
b.To what extent do students receiv e health education in recipient school
districts?
 
2.Heath Services
a.To what extent do recipients implement or support activities to increase access
to sexual health services for students?
b.To what extent do recipients implement or support activities to increase access
to beha vioral and mental health services for students?
c.To what extent do students receiv e sexual health services? T o what extent do
students receiv e beha vioral and mental health services?
 
3.Safe and Supportiv e Environments
a.To what extent do recipients pro vide support for safe and supportiv e school
environments for students and school staff ?
b.To what extent do students participate in activities that foster safe and
supportiv e environments?
 
4.Communit y Engagement
a.To what extent do recipients engage district, school, family , and communit y
partners in school health policies, progr ams, or str ategies?
 
5.Surv eillance
a.To what extent are YRBS and Profiles institutionaliz ed within the jurisdiction?
 
CDC encour ages the ev aluators to explore additional ev aluation questions that
promote capacit y building. The role of the ev aluation team is to pro vide
guidance and technical support to answering these following ev aluation
questions. Below is a summary of each ev aluation question identified in the
Evaluation Plan submitted to the CDC -DASH and the data collection methods
emplo yed for assessment.  
1. What are the experiences and perceptions of sexual health education (SHE)
instructors’ receiving SHE related technical assistance and professional
development, and what is its impact on their implementation of SHE? 
2. What is the perceiv ed value of Gender Sexualit y Alliances (GS As) to staff and
students (as part of the Safe and Supportiv e Environment (S SE) work? 
3. How is the capacit y for sexual health promotion built among Sexual Health
Advisory Committee (SHAC) members?
4. What is the perceiv ed value of newly guided resources to staff members who
support sexual health and mental health to students, and its effectiv eness tocontinue pro viding a safe and supportiv e environment? 
 
This current protocol and accompan ying instruments are being submitted in the
fall 2024 to address the question, “What are the experiences and perceptions of
sexual health education (SHE) instructors’ receiving SHE related technical
assistance and professional dev elopment, and what is its impact on their
implementation of SHE?” The following sub-research questions will also be
addressed. 
1.What roles do instructors report that CPS’ s new online asynchronous SHE/PHS
professional dev elopment pla yed in preparing them to teach SHE? 
2.What other existing resources or changes to existing resources would help
instructors in their prepar ation to teach SHE/PHS?
 
It is h ypothesiz ed that this initiativ e will achiev e the following objectiv es:  1)
Decrease in sexual risk beha viors among adolescents; 2) Increase use of
preventativ e beha viors that decrease risk for HIV , STD , and teen pregnancy

What is the contextual history of this subject area and how does this research
build upon the body of extant knowledge?
Current research has found a correlation between health beha viors and student
outcomes. In an analysis of student risk beha viors, it w as found that violence
and suicide-related beha viors, as well as risky sexual beha viors were correlated
with “lower self -reported gr ades.” (Rasberry et al, 2017). Studies ha ve shown
links between educational outcomes such as letter gr ades, test scores, or other
measures of academic achiev ement, and health-related beha viors (R asberry et
al, 2017). An arr ay of str ategies has demonstr ated evidence of impro ving
student ’s well-being and educational success. F or example, research has
indicated that comprehensiv e sexual health (CSE) education pro vides students
with the abilit y to learn concepts and master skills necessary lead sexual health y
lives as they dev elop into adulthood (Br assard & Fiorv anti, 2015). CSE is link ed
to impro ved dating and interpersonal violence-related outcomes, greater
acceptance of sexual div ersity among students, and impro ved outcomes related
to social/emotional learning and media liter acy, in addition to reductions in
pregnancies and STIs (Goldfarb & Lieberman, 2021). The creation of Genders
and Sexualities Alliance (GS A) clubs in schools (K osciw et al. , 2019)  has
demonstr ated evidence as protectiv e for L GBTQ+ students’ wellbeing and
educational success (P almer et al. , 2017). Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has
prioritiz ed supporting GS A growth throughout the district, as well as impro ving
the implementation and uptak e of comprehensiv e sexual health education in
schools. Currently , CPS’ s goal is to ha ve a GS A in ev ery school within its district
(CPS, 2019). In regard to sexual health education, the district has updated in
Sexual Health Education (SHE) policy , requiring schools to pro vide
comprehensiv e sexual health education (SHE) to Pre-K students and tr aining to
Pre-K teachers, and pro vide contr aceptiv es and menstrual h ygiene products. In
addition to this CPS team has focused efforts on impro ving the pro vision of
health services, such as sexual health and mental health, to students in the
district. T o identif y best pr actices for initiating and sustaining GS As in schools, to
support all schools across the district in implementing CSE and impro ve the
provision of health services in the district, the ev aluation team pro vides support
to the OSHW L GBTQ+ and Sexual Health T eam to support their work. A strong
literature base supports all the work that the OSHW's L GBTQ+ and Sexual
Health T eam is doing to support schools, and the examples abo ve are just two
examples.","and Student/Staff Involvement
Please provide an overview of all primary and secondary research activities
associated with this study. Please use this space to describe, as thoroughly as
possible, all that will be asked of your research subjects (e.g. surveys, focus
groups, observations, etc.)
A summary of research activities that the UIC data collection team is conducting,
which in volves inter action with human subjects, is described below . The UIC
evaluation team will be conducting data collection activities to address the
following ev aluations questions: 1) What are the experiences and perceptions of
sexual health education (SHE) instructors’ receiving SHE related technical
assistance and professional dev elopment, and what is its impact on their
implementation of SHE, 2) What is the perceiv ed value of Gender Sexualit y
Alliances (GS As) to staff and students (as part of the Safe and Supportiv e
Environment (S SE) work?, and 3) What is the perceiv ed value of newly guided
resources to staff members who support sexual health and mental health to
students, and its effectiv eness to continue pro viding a safe and supportiv e
environment? T o address the question, “What are the experiences and
perceptions of sexual health education (SHE) instructors’ receiving SHE related
technical assistance and professional dev elopment, and what is its impact on
their implementation of SHE, ” semi-structured k ey informant interviews will be
held with SHE instructors that engaged in professional dev elopment workshops
and instructors that receiv ed in-person technical assistance b y OSHW staff .
Separ ate interview guides will be dev eloped to assess participants’ experiences
and the impact of these str ategies on the implementation of SHE. 12-15 CPS
staff members who requested in-person T A, and 12-24 CPS staff members that
took CPS new SHE PD will be recruited for this ev aluation. P articipants are CPS
staff members who can be in volved in the educational setting that pro vides the
services or curriculum to the students. T o address “What is the perceiv ed value
of Gender Sexualit y Alliances (GS As) to staff and students (as part of the Safe
and Supportiv e Environment (S SE) work, ” focus groups with the CPS district
GSA leadership committee will be held to identif y how to continue to support
GSA sponsors and the sustainabilit y of GS As in their schools. The UIC ev aluation
team will hold two to three focus groups with GS A advisers, with a total of 18
participants. Lastly , UIC ev aluation team will address the following questions,
“What is the perceiv ed value of newly guided resources to staff members who
support sexual health and mental health to students, and its effectiv eness to
continue pro viding a safe and supportiv e environment?” b y conducting focus
groups with beha vioral health team members to receiv e feedback on tools and
resources, and K ey-informant semi-structured interviews with Office of Student
Health and W ellness staff on the materials. 
 
The v oluntary consent of participants will be obtained through a signed consent
document per CPS R esearch R eview Board regulations, and v erbal confirmation
before the initiation of interviews. The identities of the participants will remain
anonymous. Interviews will be recorded if the participant consented, and diligent
notes will be tak en throughout. No identifiable tr aits or notes of the participants
will be tak en, and if recorded, will be er ased to ensure confidentialit y. Similar to
interviews, during focus groups, v oluntary consent of participants will be
obtained through a signed consent document, and v erbal confirmation will be
sought before the initiation of discussion. The identities of the participants will
remain anon ymous, but participants will be reminded that their confidentialit y
cannot be guar anteed due to the nature of group discussions.  The discussion
will be recorded, and diligent notes will be tak en throughout b y the ev aluators.No identifiable tr aits or notes of the participants will be tak en, and if recorded,
will be er ased to ensure confidentialit y.
 
As a reminder , the current protocol and accompan ying instruments are being
submitted in the fall 2024 to address the question, “What are the experiences
and perceptions of sexual health education (SHE) instructors’ receiving SHE
related technical assistance and professional dev elopment, and what is its
impact on their implementation of SHE. ” The other ev aluation activities
summariz ed and described abo ve will be submitted in the future as a
modification. F or the current protocol, the specific sub-questions, 1) “What roles
do instructors report that CPS’ s new online asynchronous SHE/PHS professional
development pla yed in preparing them to teach SHE?; 2) What other existing
resources or changes to existing resources would help instructors in their
prepar ation to teach SHE/PHS?” will be addressed. A detailed description of
research activities and staff in volvement pertaining to this question and its sub-
questions are described below . 
 
OSHW and the P3RC ev aluation team will conduct 12-24 semi-structured k ey
informant interviews with SHE instructors who ha ve taken the SHE tr aining
during the SY24-25 school y ear. OSHW will pro vide UIC/P3RC personnel with a
list of participants who identified interest. UIC/P3RC personnel will follow up with
training participants who identified interest in participating in interviews via
email. Interviews will be conducted on a rolling basis throughout the SY24-25,
after SHE/PHS Instructors finish implementing SHE/PHS lessons. P articipants will
be ask ed to participate in a 45–60-minute interview held virtually on Z oom using
the UIC platform. A scheduling link will be pro vided to participants, and they will
be able to select a con venient time for them to participate that will not conflict
with their work responsibilities. . F ollow-up emails will also let participants know
that they will receiv e a $50 gift card for their participation in an interview . The
voluntary nature of this study will be stressed to interested participants during
recruitment, and OSHW team will also be reminded of this.
Informed consent documents will be reviewed with all interviewees before they
consent to participate in the interview . During interviews, participants will be
asked not to mention names of students and other staff members during the
interview . Howev er, if they are accidentally mentioned during the interview , the
names will be redacted from written tr anscripts. P articipants ma y choose to
participate in interviews, but not ha ve the interview recorded. P articipants will
be ask ed to consent to participate in the interview and be recorded during the
interview during the informed consent process, and a separ ate signature line in
the informed consent form will be pro vided for the participant to consent to
each. P articipants will be reminded that their names will not be on the interview
notes or v oice files. Individual staff members and schools will not be identified or
named in v erbal and written reports for CPS , and school staff members will be
referred to or described in the reports using gener al role descriptions, such as
school administr ator, teacher , etc. The information collected ma y be used in
academic publications or presentations, but interviewees’ names will not be used
within these manuscripts or presentations.  P articipants will be reminded that
they will receiv e a $50 gift card for their participation in the interview and will be
reminded of this at the end of the interview . These procedures are described in
the informed consent documents that are pro vided to interviewees prior to
interviews.
 
Interviews will obtain instructors’ o verall feedback and experience of the SHE
instructor tr aining and implementing sexual health education in their school. Inaddition, instructors’ perspectiv es on whether and how the SHE instructor
training helped facilitate the implementation of sexual health education in their
school and classroom and other factors that helped promote or hinder the
implementation of sexual health education in their school and classroom will be
obtained during the interviews. Notes and recordings of the interviews will be
collected b y UIC ev aluators. F ollowing the interview , an M4A audio recording
that is gener ated b y the Z oom platform will be downloaded and sa ved in
password, protected, secure location. The audio file will be used for the purposes
of transcription and deleted when tr anscriptions ha ve been completed and
verified. All notes and recordings obtained during the interviews will be stored
on password-protected computers and will be only accessible to UIC staff that is
assigned to this project.","and Analytical Technique
Please provide an overview of your research methodology and specific analytical
techniques that will be utilized as part of this study.
Data collected from interviews will be analyz ed using qualitativ e analysis
softw are, MaxQDA. The following analytical techniques will be utiliz ed during
analysis. First, a co-in vestigator and/or R esearch Assistant tr ained in qualitativ e
analysis will independently code 2 tr anscripts in MaxQDA using an initial
codebook. Next, an iter ative process will be used to refine and edit problematic
codes, code definitions, and/or inclusion/ex clusion criteria for codes.  Memos will
be dev eloped in MaxQDA to help facilitate the refinement of codes, allowing
coders to pro vide additional explanations when they feel it is w arranted and
provide context when it is not otherwise deduced from the codes alone. After
codes are refined, each coder will code 1 new tr anscript to determine o verall
doing agreement r ates using a ‘final’ codebook. If an 80% agreement is reached
between researchers, the remaining tr anscripts will be coded. Coders will meet
regularly throughout coding and analysis to discuss emerging codes and
thematic dev elopment. R esearchers will then formulate preliminary themes that
are emerging from the data. Themes/finding will be segregated into two
categories: 1) formativ e findings, which will be used to inform the dev elopment
of the initiativ e and 2) baseline findings, which will be used to establish pre-
initiativ e understandings, pr actices, and experiences and used for later
comparison in the process ev aluation.  This research methodology and analytical
technique will be specifically used for interviews with SHE instructors that
recently completed the SHE asynchronous PD ."
